Thanks for the clarification — you're almost there.

Based on what you said:

> "DBA shared me a username and password for a new database created inside SQL connection"

This strongly suggests that you're dealing with a **contained database user**, which **does allow** a password to be reset **per database**.

## ✅ What You Need to Do in DBeaver

### 🔄 Reset password for a contained database user

1. **Connect** to the SQL Server instance in DBeaver.
2. In the **Database Navigator**, expand the connection and go to the **new database** (the one the DBA added the user to).
3. Open a **new SQL Editor** for that database.
4. Run the following command **in that database**:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER [YourUsername] WITH PASSWORD = 'NewStrongPasswordHere';
   ```

   Replace:

   * `[YourUsername]` with the username your DBA gave you.
   * `'NewStrongPasswordHere'` with the new password you want.

## 🧪 Optional: Confirm the user is contained

If you're unsure and want to verify, run:

```sql
SELECT name, type_desc, authentication_type_desc
FROM sys.database_principals
WHERE name = 'YourUsername';
```

If `authentication_type_desc` returns `PASSWORD`, then it's a contained user — you're good to go.

## 🔐 Summary

* You can **reset the password just for that database**, if it's a **contained user**.
* Use `ALTER USER` — **not** `ALTER LOGIN`.

Let me know the username (or if you want help checking containment mode), and I’ll give you an exact query.
