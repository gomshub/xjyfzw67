Certainly! To accomplish this task, we'll perform the following steps using Python:

1. Read the CSV file.
2. Filter rows where the first column contains the word "version".
3. Check if the third column value is greater than a specified threshold.
4. Create a new CSV file with these filtered rows.
5. Prepare an HTML body for the email with highlighted rows.
6. Send the email with the HTML body and attach the new CSV file.

Here's a comprehensive Python script to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email import encoders

def filter_csv_and_send_email(csv_file, threshold, sender_email, receiver_email, smtp_server, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password):
    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)

    # Filter rows where the first column contains the word "version" and the third column value is greater than the threshold
    filtered_df = df[df.iloc[:, 0].str.contains("version", case=False) & (df.iloc[:, 2] > threshold)]

    # Save the filtered rows to a new CSV file
    filtered_csv_file = "filtered_rows.csv"
    filtered_df.to_csv(filtered_csv_file, index=False)

    # Prepare the HTML body with highlighted rows
    html_body = """
    <html>
        <body>
            <p>Here are the rows where the first column contains the word "version" and the third column value is greater than the threshold:</p>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>{}</tr>
                {}
            </table>
        </body>
    </html>
    """.format(
        "".join([f"<th>{col}</th>" for col in filtered_df.columns]),
        "".join([f"<tr>{''.join([f'<td>{value}</td>' for value in row])}</tr>" for row in filtered_df.values])
    )

    # Set up the email
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = receiver_email
    msg['Subject'] = "Filtered CSV Rows"

    # Attach the HTML body
    msg.attach(MIMEText(html_body, 'html'))

    # Attach the CSV file
    attachment = MIMEBase('application', 'octet-stream')
    with open(filtered_csv_file, 'rb') as file:
        attachment.set_payload(file.read())
    encoders.encode_base64(attachment)
    attachment.add_header('Content-Disposition', f'attachment; filename={filtered_csv_file}')
    msg.attach(attachment)

    # Send the email
    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, msg.as_string())

# Example usage
csv_file = 'path_to_your_csv_file.csv'
threshold = 100  # Set your threshold value
sender_email = 'your_email@example.com'
receiver_email = 'receiver_email@example.com'
smtp_server = 'smtp.example.com'
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = 'your_smtp_username'
smtp_password = 'your_smtp_password'

filter_csv_and_send_email(csv_file, threshold, sender_email, receiver_email, smtp_server, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password)
```

### Notes:

1. **Read CSV and Filter Data**: The script reads the CSV file and filters the rows based on the condition that the first column contains the word "version" and the third column value is greater than the specified threshold.

2. **Prepare HTML Body**: The HTML body is created to include the filtered rows, with each row wrapped in HTML table tags.

3. **Send Email with Attachment**: The script uses `smtplib` to send an email with the HTML body and the attached CSV file containing the filtered rows.

Ensure you replace placeholders such as `path_to_your_csv_file.csv`, `your_email@example.com`, `receiver_email@example.com`, `smtp.example.com`, and your SMTP credentials with actual values relevant to your situation.

To validate XML files before extracting the data, and to ensure that each key element and its child elements are included in the CSV for comparison, we will follow these steps:

1. **Validate XML files against an XSD schema.**
2. **Extract key elements and their child elements values from valid XML files and write them to CSV files.**
3. **Compare the key element values in the CSV files.**
4. **Check if the differences exceed a certain threshold.**
5. **Email the differences as a CSV file.**

We'll use the `lxml` library for XML validation, and `xml.etree.ElementTree` for parsing. Let's start by implementing the required functions:

### Install Required Library
Make sure to install the `lxml` library:
```sh
pip install lxml
```

### Code Implementation

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import csv
import difflib
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication
from lxml import etree

def validate_xml(xml_file, xsd_file):
    xmlschema_doc = etree.parse(xsd_file)
    xmlschema = etree.XMLSchema(xmlschema_doc)
    xml_doc = etree.parse(xml_file)
    return xmlschema.validate(xml_doc)

def extract_key_and_child_elements_to_csv(file_path, key_elements, csv_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    
    with open(csv_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        header_written = False
        for elem in key_elements:
            for key_element in root.findall(f".//{elem}"):
                row = [key_element.tag]
                child_values = []
                for child in key_element:
                    row.append(child.tag)
                    child_values.append(child.text.strip() if child.text else '')
                if not header_written:
                    csvwriter.writerow(row)
                    header_written = True
                csvwriter.writerow([key_element.tag] + child_values)

def read_csv_to_dict(csv_path):
    data = {}
    with open(csv_path, 'r') as csvfile:
        csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        headers = next(csvreader, None)
        for row in csvreader:
            if row:
                key = row[0]
                data[key] = row[1:]
    return data, headers

def compare_and_check_threshold(dict_a, dict_b, threshold):
    differences = {}
    for key in set(dict_a.keys()).union(dict_b.keys()):
        val_a = dict_a.get(key, [])
        val_b = dict_b.get(key, [])
        if val_a != val_b:
            diff = list(difflib.ndiff([' '.join(val_a)], [' '.join(val_b)]))
            diff_count = sum(1 for d in diff if d.startswith('- ') or d.startswith('+ '))
            if diff_count > threshold:
                differences[key] = diff
    return differences

def write_differences_to_csv(differences, csv_path, headers):
    with open(csv_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(headers)
        for key, diff in differences.items():
            csvwriter.writerow([key] + [' '.join(diff)])

def send_email_with_attachment(subject, body, to_email, from_email, smtp_server, smtp_port, smtp_user, smtp_pass, attachment_path):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()

    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    with open(attachment_path, 'rb') as file:
        attachment = MIMEApplication(file.read(), _subtype='csv')
        attachment.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='differences.csv')
        msg.attach(attachment)

    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(smtp_user, smtp_pass)
        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())

# File paths and threshold
file_a = 'file_a.xml'

    extract_key_and_child_elements_to_csv(file_a, key_elements, csv_a)
    extract_key_and_child_elements_to_csv(file_b, key_elements, csv_b)

    # Read CSV to dictionaries
    dict_a, headers_a = read_csv_to_dict(csv_a)
    dict_b, headers_b = read_csv_to_dict(csv_b)

    # Compare and check threshold
    differences = compare_and_check_threshold(dict_a, dict_b, threshold)

    if differences:
        # Write differences to CSV
        write_differences_to_csv(differences, differences_csv, headers_a)

    print("Comparison complete. Email sent if differences exceed the threshold.")
else:
    print("XML validation failed. Please check the XML files against the provided XSD schema.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Validate XML:**
   - `validate_xml` function checks if the XML file adheres to the provided XSD schema.

2. **Extract Key and Child Elements to CSV:**
   - `extract_key_and_child_elements_to_csv` function extracts key elements and their child elements and writes them to a CSV file.

3. **Read CSV to Dictionary:**
   - `read_csv_to_dict` function reads the CSV file into a dictionary where the key is the first column and the value is a list of the remaining columns. It also returns the headers for later use.

4. **Compare and Check Threshold:**
   - `compare_and_check_threshold` function compares the dictionaries and checks if the differences exceed the threshold. Differences are computed using `difflib.ndiff`.

5. **Write Differences to CSV:**
   - `write_differences_to_csv` function writes the differences to a CSV file.

6. **Send Email with Attachment:**
   - `send_email_with_attachment` function sends an email with the differences CSV file attached.

### Running the Code:
- Ensure you have the `lxml` library installed.
- Update the `key_elements` list with the elements you want to extract.
- Set the `threshold` for what you consider a significant difference.
- Configure the email parameters with your SMTP server details.
- Run the script. It will validate the XML files, extract data, compare differences, and email the differences if they exceed the threshold.
