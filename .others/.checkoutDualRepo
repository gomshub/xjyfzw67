In Bamboo, you can dynamically retrieve the plan branch name using the built-in variable bamboo.planRepository.branchName. This variable holds the name of the branch for the current Bamboo plan branch execution.

Here’s an updated version of the script where the feature branch name is dynamically set based on the Bamboo plan branch name:

Shell Script

# Define the repository URL
REPO_URL="https://your.git.repo.url.git"

# Define the master branch
MASTER_BRANCH="master"

# Get the feature branch name dynamically from the Bamboo plan branch name
FEATURE_BRANCH="${bamboo.planRepository.branchName}"

# Define the directories for each branch
MASTER_DIR="master-folder"
FEATURE_DIR="feature-folder"

echo "Feature branch name is: $FEATURE_BRANCH"

# Clone and checkout the master branch
echo "Cloning master branch..."
if [ ! -d "$MASTER_DIR" ]; then
  git clone -b "$MASTER_BRANCH" "$REPO_URL" "$MASTER_DIR"
else
  echo "Master directory exists. Pulling latest changes..."
  cd "$MASTER_DIR"
  git pull origin "$MASTER_BRANCH"
  cd ..
fi

# Clone and checkout the feature branch
echo "Cloning feature branch..."
if [ ! -d "$FEATURE_DIR" ]; then
  git clone -b "$FEATURE_BRANCH" "$REPO_URL" "$FEATURE_DIR"
else
  echo "Feature directory exists. Pulling latest changes..."
  cd "$FEATURE_DIR"
  git pull origin "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
  cd ..
fi

echo "Branches successfully checked out."

Key Changes
	1.	FEATURE_BRANCH Variable:
	•	Dynamically set to the Bamboo plan branch name using bamboo.planRepository.branchName.
	2.	Echo the Branch Name:
	•	The script prints the feature branch name for debugging purposes (echo "Feature branch name is: $FEATURE_BRANCH").

Steps in Bamboo Plan
	1.	Add a Script task in your Bamboo job.
	2.	Copy and paste the script above.
	3.	Bamboo will replace the variable ${bamboo.planRepository.branchName} with the actual branch name at runtime.

Example

If the Bamboo plan branch name is feature/add-login, the script will dynamically set FEATURE_BRANCH to feature/add-login and checkout this branch.
