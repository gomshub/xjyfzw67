Since you created the AWS Transfer Family server and user via Terraform but didn’t set a password, you won’t be able to connect via SFTP because AWS Transfer Family doesn’t allow you to edit the password from the console for service-managed users.

Solution: Manually Set or Update the Password via AWS CLI

Even though you created the user via Terraform, AWS requires you to explicitly set a password via the AWS CLI or SDK. Here’s how:

1. Get Your AWS Transfer Server ID

Run the following command to list your Transfer Family servers:

aws transfer list-servers

Look for "ServerId" in the output (e.g., s-1234567890abcdefg).

2. Set or Update the User’s Password

Now, run this command to update the user with a password:

aws transfer update-user \
  --server-id s-1234567890abcdefg \
  --user-name your-sftp-user \
  --password "YourSecurePassword"

3. Test SFTP Connection

Use an SFTP client (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP, or command line) to test.

Command-line SFTP:

sftp your-sftp-user@your-transfer-endpoint

You can find your Transfer Family endpoint in the AWS Console under AWS Transfer > Your Server > Endpoint.
