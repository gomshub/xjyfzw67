DBeaver does not use Maven or settings.xml directly when downloading JDBC drivers — it downloads them from public repositories or bundled sources on its own. So even if your organization uses an internal Nexus/Artifactory Maven repo, DBeaver will not automatically use your Maven settings.xml file for JDBC drivers.

However, you can manually configure DBeaver to use a JDBC driver JAR from your internal Artifactory.

⸻

Option 1: Manually Download the JAR from Artifactory and Add It in DBeaver

Steps:
	1.	Use Maven or Browser to Download the JAR
	•	If Maven is configured with your internal Artifactory via ~/.m2/settings.xml, you can run:

mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc:12.4.2.jre11


	•	Or open Artifactory in your browser and download the .jar.

	2.	Open DBeaver
	•	Go to Database > Driver Manager.
	•	Select SQL Server and click Edit.
	•	In the Libraries tab, click Add File.
	•	Select the downloaded .jar file.
	3.	Save and Test Connection

Option 2: Use a Custom Driver Definition in DBeaver (Pointing to Maven JAR)

If you always want to use your own JAR:
	1.	Go to Database > Driver Manager > New.
	2.	Name: SQL Server (Custom)
	3.	Class name: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
	4.	Add your downloaded .jar in Libraries tab.
	5.	Click OK, then use this driver when creating a connection.
