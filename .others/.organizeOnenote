Got it 👍 you want a clear icon for SFTP-related tasks / follow-ups (like when coordinating with the SFTP/transfer/file-movement team).

Here are a few good symbolic options you can use in OneNote:
	•	📂 Folder/File → represents file transfers
	•	🔑 Key → secure key-based SFTP access
	•	📡 Antenna → data transmission
	•	🔐 Lock with keyhole → secure transfer
	•	📨 Envelope with arrow → file delivery

👉 My recommendation for SFTP team follow-ups is:

📂 SFTP Team → File movement / transfer requests
or
🔐 SFTP Team → Secure file transfer issues

⸻

Example with your workflow:

[ ] 🧩 [JIRA-1234] Fix ECS deployment error – 🛠 In Dev  
     Notes: Debugging ALB module  

[ ] 📂 Follow up with SFTP team on user onboarding – ⏳ Pending  
     Notes: Requested SSH key setup  

[ ] 🔒 Request firewall rule update (Security) – ⛔ On Hold  
     Notes: Ticket SEC-4567 raised  

[ ] 📧 Follow up with AWS provider – ⏳ In Progress  
     Notes: Waiting for ACM cert confirmation  


⸻

👉 Do you want me to add 📂 SFTP Team into the symbol legend template so you have one standard legend for all teams (Security, Cloud, Batch, SFTP, Provider)?

Perfect 👍 now we’re getting into real-life task management in OneNote where you want:
	1.	Tasks with JIRA tickets (your dev/test work).
	2.	Follow-ups with internal teams (security, cloud, batch automation, etc.).
	3.	Follow-ups with external providers via email.
	4.	Each type should have a symbol / icon so you can identify at a glance what kind of follow-up it is.

⸻

🏷 Symbol Legend for Quick Identification

Here are some clean, memorable symbols you can use in front of tasks:
	•	🧩 JIRA Task → Standard dev/test issue
	•	🔒 Security Team follow-up
	•	☁️ Cloud/Infra Team follow-up
	•	🔄 Batch Process Automation follow-up
	•	📧 Email Provider / Vendor follow-up
	•	📌 General Reminder / Admin task

⸻

⸻

🔗 Outlook Sync Still Works
	•	Right-click any of these lines → Outlook Tasks → add due date.
	•	Symbols + JIRA IDs stay in Outlook / To Do, so you’ll see:

🔒 Request firewall rule update (Security) – Pending



⸻

⚡ This way, you can scan your OneNote page visually:
	•	🧩 = Dev work
	•	🔒 / ☁️ / 🔄 = internal follow-ups
	•	📧 = external follow-up

⸻

👉 Do you want me to create a Weekly OneNote template (Mon–Fri) using this symbol + status + notes format, so you can just duplicate each week and fill in tasks/follow-ups?

Ahh got it 👍
You don’t just want a generic In Progress / On Hold / Completed — you want statuses that match the SDLC workflow like:
	•	🛠 In Dev
	•	🧪 In FAT (Functional Acceptance Testing)
	•	🔬 In UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
	•	🚀 Ready for Prod / Released
	•	⛔ On Hold

That makes your OneNote task tracker much closer to how JIRA workflows actually run.

⸻

Here’s how your Rolling To-Do with Notes would look with these statuses:

⸻

🔴 Today

[ ] [JIRA-1234] Fix ECS deployment error – 🛠 In Dev
  Notes: Debugging Terraform ALB module, pending security group change

[ ] [JIRA-5678] Add RabbitMQ queue arguments – 🧪 In FAT
  Notes: Test queue bindings with staging setup

  Notes: UAT team validating IAM roles + S3 triggers

[ ] [JIRA-2468] Review RabbitMQ config – ⛔ On Hold

  Notes: Karpenter vs Cluster Autoscaler to be finalized

⸻

🔗 Outlook Sync Still Works
	•	You can still flag tasks to Outlook (due dates + reminders).
	•	Status is just part of your text → won’t break the sync.
	•	Outlook will show:

[JIRA-1234] Fix ECS deployment error – In Dev

(so you know the lifecycle stage).

⸻

👉 Do you want me to expand this into a Weekly Template (Mon–Fri) using your Dev → FAT → UAT → Prod flow so you can plan where each JIRA ticket stands during the week?


Perfect 👌 let’s build a Weekly Rolling To-Do Template for OneNote that already has Mon–Fri pages with JIRA + Status + Outlook sync built in.

⸻

📒 Weekly Rolling To-Do (OneNote + Outlook)

📅 Week of: ____ (DD–DD MMM YYYY)

⸻

🔗 Outlook Sync
	•	Right-click any row → Outlook Tasks → pick Today/Tomorrow/Next Week.
	•	Task syncs into Outlook and Microsoft To Do with reminders.
	•	Completion syncs both ways (check in Outlook → auto-check in OneNote).

⸻

🔄 Weekly Workflow
	•	Monday morning → Pull 2–3 items from This Week → Monday table, flag urgent ones to Outlook.
	•	Daily → Update Status (⏳ / ⛔ / ✅ / 🔜) + add notes.
	•	Friday afternoon → Move unfinished items to Next Week page.
	•	Review “Later” list once a week → promote if needed.

⸻

✨ With this setup:
	•	Each day has its own sectioned table (great for JIRA + notes).
	•	You keep rolling tasks forward (Method 2).
	•	Important tasks get synced into Outlook for reminders (Method 3).

⸻

👉 Do you want me to also prepare this as a OneNote template file (.onepkg) that you can import directly instead of copy-pasting tables every time?


Perfect 👍 Let’s build both for you:

⸻

🟢 Option 1: Method 2 (Rolling To-Do) with JIRA + Status in OneNote

Here’s a template table you can copy into OneNote to track tasks in a Kanban-style format:

✅	Task	JIRA ID	Status	Notes
[ ]	Fix ECS deployment error	JIRA-1234	⏳ In Progress	Debugging Terraform ALB module
[ ]	Add RabbitMQ queue arguments	JIRA-5678	⛔ On Hold	Waiting for product team input
[ ]	Automate S3-to-Lambda pipeline	JIRA-7890	🔜 Not Started	Terraform IAM roles needed


⸻

🔹 How to use this table:
	•	✅ Column = OneNote checkbox (Ctrl+1) → tick when done.
	•	Task = Short description.
	•	JIRA ID = Hyperlink to ticket.
	•	Status = Use emojis or plain text (⏳ In Progress / ⛔ On Hold / ✅ Completed / 🔜 Not Started).
	•	Notes = Extra context.

👉 You can have three tables (Today / This Week / Later) on the same page for rolling tracking.

⸻

🟢 Option 2: Method 2 + Method 3 (OneNote + Outlook Integration)

This combo lets you:
	•	Organize tasks in OneNote (Method 2).
	•	Send selected tasks into Outlook for reminders & mobile sync (Method 3).

⸻

🔹 Step 1: Rolling To-Do in OneNote

Keep the same table as above, OR just a bulleted list:

🔴 Today
[ ] [JIRA-1234] Fix ECS deployment error – ⏳ In Progress
[ ] [JIRA-5678] Add RabbitMQ queue arguments – ⛔ On Hold

🟡 This Week
[ ] [JIRA-7890] Automate S3-to-Lambda pipeline – 🔜 Not Started


⸻

🔹 Step 2: Send Important Tasks to Outlook
	1.	Right-click a task in OneNote → Outlook Tasks.
	2.	Pick due date (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, Custom Date).
	3.	The task gets a red flag + syncs into Outlook Tasks / Microsoft To Do.
	•	You get reminders.
	•	If you check it off in Outlook/To Do → it updates in OneNote automatically.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Daily Flow
	•	Morning → Move 2–3 items from This Week → Today. Flag urgent ones to Outlook for reminders.
	•	During the day → Update status in OneNote (⏳/⛔/✅).
	•	End of day → Check off completed tasks in Outlook & OneNote, move pending tasks forward.

⸻

✅ Benefit:
	•	OneNote = your planning hub (organized by JIRA + status + notes).
	•	Outlook = your execution tool (reminders, mobile sync, calendar view).

⸻

👉 Do you want me to prepare a ready-to-paste OneNote daily template (with the three sections + JIRA/status table + Outlook task flags) so you can literally drop it into your office OneNote and start tomorrow?
