In the context of the Neoxam application, LDAP can be used for user authentication and authorization purposes. Neoxam may integrate LDAP to manage user accounts, access control, and directory services.

For example, Neoxam could utilize LDAP to authenticate users logging into the application by validating their credentials against the LDAP server. This allows for centralized user management, where user information and access privileges are stored in the LDAP directory.

LDAP can also be used to manage user roles and permissions within the Neoxam application. By leveraging LDAP's directory services, Neoxam can define user groups, assign roles, and control access to specific features or data based on LDAP-based authorization rules.

Overall, integrating LDAP into the Neoxam application helps streamline user management, enhance security, and provide a centralized approach to authentication and authorization.
