To automate the process of copying pack files from Git to S3 and installing them on a Kubernetes container application using ArgoCD and Bamboo, follow this workflow:

### 1. **High-Level Overview of the Process:**
- **Source (Git)**: The user commits the pack files to a Git repository.
- **CI/CD (Bamboo)**: Bamboo detects the commit and triggers a pipeline to:
  - Copy the pack files from Git to an S3 bucket.
  - Trigger a deployment in ArgoCD.
- **ArgoCD**: ArgoCD deploys an updated application, mounts the S3 files, and runs the shell script inside the Kubernetes container to install the packs.

### 2. **Detailed Workflow:**

#### **Step 1: Bamboo Pipeline to Upload Pack Files to S3**
Bamboo will run a build pipeline that copies the pack files from the Git repository to an S3 bucket.

**Bamboo Plan Configuration:**

1. **Git Checkout**: Use Bamboo's built-in Git capabilities to check out the latest code when the user commits the pack files.

2. **Copy Pack Files to S3**:
   In your Bamboo build plan, add a script task to copy the pack files to an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI:

   **Script Task in Bamboo**:
   ```bash
   # Install AWS CLI if not available
   if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null
   then
       pip install awscli --upgrade --user
   fi

   # Copy pack files to S3 bucket
   aws s3 cp /path/to/local/pack-files s3://your-s3-bucket/pack-files/ --recursive
   ```

   Ensure you configure Bamboo with the necessary AWS credentials either through environment variables or IAM roles.

#### **Step 2: Update ArgoCD Application with S3 Information**
Once the pack files are uploaded to S3, the next step is to update the ArgoCD application to deploy them.

There are two ways to handle this:
1. **Use a Helm Chart or Kubernetes Manifest** that references the S3 bucket to download the pack files.
2. **Sync the ArgoCD Application** from the Git repository tracked by ArgoCD after uploading the files to S3.

For simplicity, I’ll focus on option 2, where ArgoCD syncs from Git, and the application fetches the files from S3.

#### **Step 3: Kubernetes Deployment to Download from S3 and Install Pack Files**

In the Kubernetes deployment, you will configure the application to download the pack files from S3 and run the installation shell script.

Here’s how you can configure your deployment to download the files from S3 and execute the shell script.

1. **S3 Download in Shell Script**:
   Modify your shell script (`install_script.sh`) to download the pack files from the S3 bucket before installing them:

   **Example `install_script.sh`**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Install AWS CLI if not available in the container
   if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null
   then
       echo "Installing AWS CLI..."
       pip install awscli --upgrade --user
   fi

   # Download the pack files from S3
   echo "Downloading pack files from S3..."
   aws s3 cp s3://your-s3-bucket/pack-files/ /app/binaries/pack-files/ --recursive

   # Install the pack files
   echo "Installing pack files..."
   cp /app/binaries/pack-files/* /desired/target/

   echo "Pack files installed."
   ```

2. **Kubernetes Deployment Manifest**:
   Your Kubernetes deployment should mount the `install_script.sh` into the container and ensure it’s executed when the container starts.

   **Example Deployment**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
     namespace: your-namespace
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-container
           image: your-application-image
           volumeMounts:
           - name: install-script
             mountPath: /app/binaries/install_script.sh
             subPath: install_script.sh
           command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
           args:
           - |
             chmod +x /app/binaries/install_script.sh
             /app/binaries/install_script.sh
         volumes:
         - name: install-script
           configMap:
             name: install-script-config
   ```

   **ConfigMap for the Script**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: install-script-config
     namespace: your-namespace
   data:
     install_script.sh: |
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "Starting installation from S3..."
       # Your script content (same as the above example)
   ```

3. **Git Commit to Trigger ArgoCD**:
   - Ensure the Kubernetes manifests (like the `Deployment` and `ConfigMap` shown above) are stored in a Git repository tracked by ArgoCD.
   - After Bamboo uploads the files to S3, the pipeline should commit any necessary updates (if any) to the Git repo.

   **Automated Bamboo Task to Commit to Git**:
   - After uploading files to S3, use Bamboo to commit any necessary changes (e.g., updating versions or configurations) to the Git repository tracked by ArgoCD:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git add .
     git commit -m "Update pack files"
     git push origin main
     ```

#### **Step 4: ArgoCD Sync and Deployment**
1. **ArgoCD Auto-Sync**: 
   Ensure ArgoCD is set to auto-sync the application whenever a commit is detected in the Git repository.

2. **ArgoCD Application**:
   Make sure the ArgoCD application is configured to track the Git repository where the Kubernetes manifests are stored:

   **ArgoCD Application Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: my-app
     namespace: argocd
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: 'https://github.com/your-repo/app-repo.git'
       path: .
       targetRevision: HEAD
     destination:
       server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
       namespace: your-namespace
     syncPolicy:
       automated:
         prune: true
         selfHeal: true
   ```

3. **Result**:
   - ArgoCD detects the new commit pushed by Bamboo and syncs the application.
   - The Kubernetes deployment in your cluster is updated to download the pack files from S3 and execute the shell script to install the pack files.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **User commits** pack files to Git.
2. **Bamboo Pipeline**:
   - Copies the pack files to S3.
   - Optionally commits any necessary updates to the Git repository tracked by ArgoCD.
3. **ArgoCD Sync**:
   - Detects the Git changes and applies them to the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - The container downloads the pack files from S3 and runs the shell script to install them.

This approach ensures that your application is always up-to-date with the latest pack files, automatically syncing changes from Git to your Kubernetes cluster via ArgoCD, with Bamboo managing the file upload process to S3.
