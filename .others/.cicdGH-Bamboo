Got it — your organization wants you to use “Gateway Runner” to trigger Bamboo from GitHub.
This is a common enterprise setup where GitHub Actions triggers Bamboo indirectly through a secure gateway runner (a small agent/API proxy your company exposes).

Below is the clean explanation + architecture + sample GitHub workflow that uses a gateway runner to start a Bamboo plan.

✅ What is a Gateway Runner?

A gateway runner is:
	•	A proxy endpoint created by your DevOps/Infra team
	•	It receives API calls from GitHub Actions
	•	It authenticates/validates the request
	•	It triggers Bamboo internally behind the firewall
	•	GitHub never calls Bamboo directly

✔ Why companies use it:
	•	Bamboo is usually on-prem, not public
	•	GitHub cannot reach internal networks
	•	The gateway runner acts as a bridge

⸻

🟦 Current Architecture (GitHub → Gateway Runner → Bamboo)

GitHub Actions (Repo A)
        |
        v
 Gateway Runner  (HTTP/REST endpoint)
        |
        v
     Bamboo Server
        |
        v
   Tests + Build + Deploy

This is the exact flow they want you to use.

🟦 Current GitHub Workflow Using Gateway Runner

➤ Repo A: .github/workflows/release.yml

name: Trigger Bamboo via Gateway Runner

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  trigger-bamboo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Trigger Gateway Runner
        run: |
          VERSION=${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}

          curl -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GATEWAY_TOKEN }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            https://gateway.company.com/run-bamboo \
            -d "{\"plan\": \"PROJECT-PLAN\", \"version\": \"$VERSION\"}"

Required Secret:
	•	GATEWAY_TOKEN — a token provided by DevOps team for the gateway runner.

Gateway Runner does:
	•	Authenticates GitHub request
	•	Calls Bamboo REST API:

/rest/api/latest/queue/PROJECT-PLAN


	•	Passes version/tag to Bamboo
	•	Starts the CI/CD pipeline

🟩 Future Architecture (Once DevOps Moves Fully to GitHub)

When DevOps also moves to GitHub:

Repo A (Devs) ──→ Repo B (DevOps) ──→ ArgoCD ──→ Kubernetes
       release        CI tests           GitOps        deploy

No gateway runner needed.
No Bamboo needed.
Everything is GitHub → GitHub → ArgoCD.

⸻

🟩 Future GitHub-to-GitHub Workflow Example

Repo A triggers Repo B

curl -X POST \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.DEVOPS_PAT }}" \
 https://api.github.com/repos/org/repo-b/dispatches \
 -d "{\"event_type\": \"deploy\", \"client_payload\": {\"version\": \"$VERSION\"}}"

Repo B receives the event → tests → updates manifests → Argo deploys

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [deploy]


⸻

🟢 Summary

NOW (Hybrid GH + Bamboo):
	•	Use gateway runner to trigger Bamboo plan.
	•	GitHub Action → Gateway → Bamboo.

LATER (Full GitHub):
	•	Use repository_dispatch to trigger DevOps repo workflows.
	•	GitHub → GitHub → ArgoCD GitOps.
