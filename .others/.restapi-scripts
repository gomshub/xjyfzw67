You can make the same requests in Python using the `requests` library. Here's a script that:

1. Requests an API key via a POST request.
2. Uses the API key to make a GET request to get data.
3. Handles the case where the API key has expired.
4. Signs out with the API key.

It also uses a proxy.

```python
import requests

# Endpoint URLs
API_TOKEN_URL = "https://example.com/api/token"
DATA_URL = "https://example.com/api/data"
SIGN_OUT_URL = "https://example.com/api/signout"

# Credentials
USERNAME = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Proxy
PROXY = {
    "http": "http://proxyp01:8080",
    "https": "http://proxyp01:8080",
}

# Function to request an API key
def get_apikey():
    response = requests.post(
        API_TOKEN_URL,
        data={"username": USERNAME, "password": PASSWORD},
        proxies=PROXY
    )
    
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Failed to obtain API key.")
        exit(1)
    
    return response.text.strip()

# Function to sign out
def sign_out(apikey):
    response = requests.post(
        SIGN_OUT_URL,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {apikey}"},
        proxies=PROXY
    )
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Signed out.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to sign out. HTTP status code: {response.status_code}")

# Main flow
apikey = get_apikey()

while True:
    response = requests.get(
        DATA_URL,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {apikey}"},
        proxies=PROXY
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open("response.txt", "w") as file:
            file.write(response.text)
        print("Data saved to response.txt")
        break
    elif response.status_code == 401:
        print("API key expired, requesting a new one...")
        apikey = get_apikey()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to get data. HTTP status code: {response.status_code}")
        exit(1)

# Sign out with the API key
sign_out(apikey)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Request an API Key (`get_apikey` function)**:
   - Sends a `POST` request with the `username` and `password`.
   - Uses the `proxies` parameter to pass the proxy.
   - Exits the program if the API key cannot be obtained.

2. **Get Data**:
   - Uses the API key to send a `GET` request to the data endpoint.
   - Handles different response codes:
     - If the response code is `200`, the data is saved to `response.txt`.
     - If the response code is `401`, it requests a new API key (assuming it expired).
     - For other response codes, it prints an error message and exits.

3. **Sign Out (`sign_out` function)**:
   - Sends a `POST` request to the sign-out endpoint to end the session.

4. **Proxy**:
   - The proxy is passed using the `proxies` dictionary, with both `http` and `https` keys.

Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it with:
```sh
pip install requests
```


If the `apikey` is returned directly (e.g., in plain text) and you want to save the response from the `GET` request as a file, you can modify the script as follows:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Endpoint URLs
API_TOKEN_URL="https://example.com/api/token"
DATA_URL="https://example.com/api/data"
SIGN_OUT_URL="https://example.com/api/signout"

# Credentials
USERNAME="your_username"
PASSWORD="your_password"

# File to save the response
OUTPUT_FILE="response.txt"

# Function to request an API key
get_apikey() {
    apikey=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        -d "username=${USERNAME}&password=${PASSWORD}" \
        "${API_TOKEN_URL}")

    if [[ -z "$apikey" ]]; then
        echo "Failed to obtain API key."
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Function to sign out
sign_out() {
    curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${apikey}" "${SIGN_OUT_URL}" > /dev/null
    echo "Signed out."
}

# Get the API key initially
get_apikey

# Try to get data with the API key
while true; do
    response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${apikey}" "${DATA_URL}" -o "${OUTPUT_FILE}")
    http_code="${response: -3}"

    if [[ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]]; then
        echo "Data saved to ${OUTPUT_FILE}"
        break
    elif [[ "$http_code" -eq 401 ]]; then
        echo "API key expired, requesting a new one..."
        get_apikey
    else
        echo "Failed to get data. HTTP status code: $http_code"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Sign out with the API key
sign_out
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **API Key Retrieval**:
   - The `apikey` is obtained directly from the `curl` response without using JSON parsing.

2. **Save Response to File**:
   - The `-o "${OUTPUT_FILE}"` flag is used in the `curl` command to save the GET request response to a file named `response.txt`.
  
3. **Handle Response Codes**:
   - `http_code` is extracted from the response to check if it's `200`, `401`, or an error code.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - When the response is successfully received (`200`), the message indicates that the data has been saved to the file.

This script works for APIs that return the `apikey` in plain text and need to save the GET response to a file.

Here’s a PowerShell script that demonstrates how to obtain an API key by sending a username and password to an endpoint, use that API key to make a request, and handle the scenario where the API key expires (getting a new one as needed).

This script assumes the following:
- `AUTH_ENDPOINT`: The API endpoint for logging in.
- `DATA_ENDPOINT`: The API endpoint where the data or file is retrieved from.
- It saves the API key in memory and makes a new login request when a 401 (Unauthorized) response is received.

```powershell
# Variables for API endpoints and credentials
$auth_endpoint = "https://example.com/api/login"
$data_endpoint = "https://example.com/api/data"
$username = "your_username"
$password = "your_password"

# Function to get a new API key
function Get-ApiKey {
    Write-Output "Fetching new API key..."

    # Prepare the body for the login request
    $body = @{
        username = $username
        password = $password
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    # Make the login request
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $auth_endpoint -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body

    # Extract the API key from the response
    $apiKey = $response.apiKey

    # Check if the API key was successfully retrieved
    if ($apiKey) {
        Write-Output "API key obtained."
        return $apiKey
    } else {
        Write-Error "Failed to obtain API key."
        exit 1
    }
}

# Function to make a request with the API key
function Make-Request {
    param (
        [string]$apiKey
    )

    # Prepare the headers with the API key
    $headers = @{
        Authorization = "Bearer $apiKey"
    }

    # Make the data request
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $data_endpoint -Method Get -Headers $headers -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    # Check if the API key is expired (401 Unauthorized)
    if ($response.StatusCode -eq 401) {
        Write-Output "API key expired. Fetching a new API key..."
        $apiKey = Get-ApiKey
        Make-Request -apiKey $apiKey  # Retry with the new API key
    } else {
        # Save the response (assuming it's a file or some data you want to store in output.txt)
        Write-Output "Request successful. Saving output to output.txt."
        $response | Out-File "output.txt"
    }
}

# Main script logic
# First, get a new API key
$apiKey = Get-ApiKey

# Make the request with the API key
Make-Request -apiKey $apiKey
```

### Explanation:
1. **`Get-ApiKey`**: This function logs in to the API by sending the username and password to the login endpoint. It extracts the API key from the JSON response and returns it.
2. **`Make-Request`**: This function makes the request to retrieve data using the API key. If it receives a 401 status code (indicating the key is expired), it logs in again to fetch a new key and retries the request.
3. **Main Logic**: The script first fetches the API key, then makes a request to get the output file or data. If the API key is expired, it automatically fetches a new one.

### Notes:
- `Invoke-RestMethod` is used for making API calls.
- `ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` ensures that the script doesn't stop execution due to an error, allowing us to check the status code and retry if necessary.

Replace the `auth_endpoint`, `data_endpoint`, and credentials (`$username`, `$password`) with actual values as per your API.

This script will work in Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core.
