To determine the number of rows created in a specific year and the size of those rows in GB in Oracle Database, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Count Rows Created in a Specific Year

Assuming you have a `created_at` column that records the timestamp when rows are created, you can count the rows created in a specific year using the `EXTRACT` function:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2023;
```

### Step 2: Calculate the Size of Rows Created in a Specific Year

To calculate the size of these rows, you can use the `DBMS_LOB` package for LOB data types, or `VSIZE` for other data types. However, for a more comprehensive size calculation, you may need to consider all columns and their data types. 

Here’s an example that gives a rough estimate of the size by summing the lengths of each column in bytes:

```sql
SELECT SUM(VSIZE(column1) + VSIZE(column2) + VSIZE(column3) + ...) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) AS size_gb
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2023;
```

Replace `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, etc., with your actual column names.

### Step 3: Use DBA_SEGMENTS for Accurate Size

For a more accurate and comprehensive size calculation, you can use the `DBA_SEGMENTS` view to get the size of the segments allocated for the table. However, this view provides the total size of the table, not just the rows created in a specific year. If you want to estimate the size more precisely, you may need to perform some additional calculations or use the `DBMS_SPACE` package.

Here’s a query to get the total size of the table:

```sql
SELECT SEGMENT_NAME, BYTES / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) AS size_gb
FROM DBA_SEGMENTS
WHERE SEGMENT_NAME = 'YOUR_TABLE'
AND SEGMENT_TYPE = 'TABLE';
```

### Combining Both Steps

Combining both steps into a single script that provides both the row count and the estimated size in GB for rows created in a specific year:

```sql
-- Counting rows created in a specific year
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2023;

-- Estimating the size of these rows in GB
SELECT SUM(VSIZE(column1) + VSIZE(column2) + VSIZE(column3) + ...) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) AS size_gb
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2023;
```

### Example

Assuming your table `orders` has columns `order_id`, `order_date`, `customer_id`, and `order_amount`:

```sql
-- Counting rows created in 2023
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023;

-- Estimating the size of these rows in GB
SELECT SUM(VSIZE(order_id) + VSIZE(order_date) + VSIZE(customer_id) + VSIZE(order_amount)) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) AS size_gb
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023;
```

By running these queries, you can get both the number of rows created in a specific year and an estimate of their size in GB. For a more accurate size calculation, especially for large tables or tables with complex data types, consider using the `DBMS_SPACE` package or analyzing the storage statistics more deeply.

To filter rows in a table by the year they were created, you typically need a column that stores the creation timestamp, such as `created_at` or `creation_date`. Assuming you have such a column, you can use the `EXTRACT` function to get the year from a date or timestamp column in Oracle SQL.

Here's a general approach to filter rows by a specific year:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2023;
```

This query extracts the year from the `created_at` column and compares it to the desired year (2023 in this example).

If you want to dynamically specify the year, you can use a bind variable or a parameter. Here’s an example using a bind variable:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = :year;
```

When running this query, you would then supply the value for `:year`.

### Example with specific year filtering
Suppose your table is named `orders` and has a column `order_date` that stores the timestamp of when the order was created. If you want to get all rows where the `order_date` is in the year 2021, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2021;
```

### Example with a range of years
If you need to filter rows created within a range of years, you can modify the query to use a range condition:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) BETWEEN 2020 AND 2023;
```

### Example with specific date format
If your date column is stored as a string, you would first need to convert it to a date type using the `TO_DATE` function. Here is an example assuming `order_date` is stored as a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD':

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(order_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')) = 2023;
```

### Handling performance considerations
For large tables, using `EXTRACT` in the `WHERE` clause can be inefficient because it requires scanning the entire table. If you frequently query by year, consider creating a function-based index on `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)`:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_year_created_at ON your_table (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at));
```

This can significantly improve query performance for such filters.

To get the last 10 rows of a table in Oracle Database, you typically use the `ROWNUM` pseudo-column in combination with a subquery that orders the rows. Here’s a common approach:

1. **Order the rows** to determine which ones are the "last" according to your criteria.
2. **Limit the result** to the last 10 rows.

Here is a step-by-step example:

Suppose you have a table named `your_table` with a column `id` that you want to use to determine the order. If `id` is the column that determines the row's position (e.g., higher `id` means later rows), you can do the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM your_table
    ORDER BY id DESC
) 
WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
```

In this query:
- The inner query `SELECT * FROM your_table ORDER BY id DESC` sorts the table in descending order, so the "last" rows according to `id` are at the top.
- The outer query `SELECT * FROM (...) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10` limits the result to the first 10 rows of this sorted list, which corresponds to the last 10 rows in the original order.

If you want the results to be in the original order, you can add another layer of sorting:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM (
        SELECT * FROM your_table
        ORDER BY id DESC
    ) 
    WHERE ROWNUM <= 10
)
ORDER BY id;
```

In this extended query:
- The innermost query sorts the rows in descending order.
- The middle query limits to the top 10 rows.
- The outer query re-sorts these 10 rows in ascending order to match the original order.

Adjust the `ORDER BY` clause based on the specific criteria you have for determining the last rows (it could be based on a timestamp, another column, etc.).
