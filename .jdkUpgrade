If your project does not use a build tool like Maven or Gradle, and consists of plain Java files organized into a module, you can still update the Java version, package an executable JAR, and resolve any compatibility issues manually. Here’s how:

1. Update Java Version
	•	Install a Newer JDK: Download and install the desired JDK (e.g., Java 11, 17, or 21).
	•	Set the New JDK:
	•	Update the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the new JDK.
	•	Update the PATH variable to include the new JDK’s bin directory.

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/new/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH


	•	Check the Java Version:

java -version

2. Compile the Code
	•	Use the javac command to compile all .java files in your module directory.

javac -d out -sourcepath src -source 17 -target 17 src/**/*.java

	•	src: Root directory of your source files.
	•	out: Directory where compiled .class files will be placed.

3. Package the Executable JAR
	•	Create a MANIFEST.MF file in a temporary directory (e.g., temp/):

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: com.example.MainClass

Replace com.example.MainClass with the fully qualified name of your main class.

	•	Use the jar command to package the JAR:

jar cfm app.jar temp/MANIFEST.MF -C out .

This will create app.jar with the specified main class.

4. Test the JAR
	•	Run the JAR file:

java -jar app.jar


	•	If it runs successfully, your application is ready for further testing.

5. Resolve Version Incompatibilities

When upgrading from Java 8 to a newer version, some APIs may be deprecated or removed. Address incompatibilities as follows:
	1.	Analyze Compatibility:
Use jdeps to analyze dependencies:

jdeps --multi-release 17 -cp app.jar


	2.	Handle Removed/Deprecated APIs:
	•	Replace removed APIs with newer equivalents.
	•	Refer to Java SE documentation for updates on removed or deprecated APIs.
	3.	Update Reflection Code:
	•	Java 9+ introduces stricter module system restrictions on reflection.
	•	Use --add-opens or --add-modules JVM options to bypass issues temporarily, but update the code for long-term solutions.

6. Testing
	•	Write test classes for all major functionalities.
	•	Compile and run tests using the JDK:

javac -d out -cp . src/**/*.java tests/**/*.java
java -cp out TestMainClass


	•	Fix issues as they arise.
