To mount or link an NFS (Network File System) on a server, follow these steps:

### Mounting an NFS

1. **Install NFS Utilities**:
   Make sure the NFS client package is installed on your server. For different Linux distributions, use:

   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install nfs-common
     ```

   - **CentOS/RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install nfs-utils
     ```

2. **Create a Mount Point**:
   Choose or create a directory where you want to mount the NFS share. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share
   ```

3. **Mount the NFS Share**:
   Use the `mount` command to mount the NFS share to your mount point. Replace `nfs_server_ip:/path/to/nfs/share` with the appropriate NFS server IP address and the path to the NFS export.
   ```bash
   sudo mount nfs_server_ip:/path/to/nfs/share /mnt/nfs_share
   ```

4. **Persistent Mount (Optional)**:
   To ensure the NFS share mounts automatically at boot, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`. Open `/etc/fstab` with a text editor and add the following line:
   ```fstab
   nfs_server_ip:/path/to/nfs/share /mnt/nfs_share nfs defaults 0 0
   ```

### Checking Mounted NFS

1. **List Mounted File Systems**:
   To check which filesystems are currently mounted, including NFS, use the `mount` command:
   ```bash
   mount | grep nfs
   ```

   This will list all mounted filesystems and filter for NFS mounts.

2. **Using `df` Command**:
   The `df` command displays the amount of disk space used and available on mounted filesystems. To list NFS mounts, use:
   ```bash
   df -hT | grep nfs
   ```

3. **Using `/proc/mounts`**:
   The `/proc/mounts` file contains information about all mounted filesystems. You can view it with:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/mounts | grep nfs
   ```

4. **Using `showmount` Command**:
   The `showmount` command can display the NFS server's exported filesystems. To use it, you need to specify the NFS server:
   ```bash
   showmount -e nfs_server_ip
   ```

   This command will show all available NFS shares on the specified server, which can help verify if the intended NFS export is available for mounting.

By following these steps, you can successfully mount an NFS on a server and verify the mounted NFS shares.
