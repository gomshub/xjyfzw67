Great question. Let’s clarify your situation:

🎯 Problem Statement:
You have a Git repo with only a pom.xml, no test code, no src/test/java, no .feature files — yet it is somehow being used in a Bamboo plan to run Karate tests.

⸻

🔍 Key Possibilities to Investigate

✅ 1. Pom.xml Might Reference Another Git Repo as a Dependency

Your pom.xml may be pulling Karate test artifacts (features or runners) from Artifactory or another internal Maven repository.

Look inside the pom.xml for this:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.yourcompany.qa</groupId>
  <artifactId>karate-tests</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

➡️ This means the actual .feature files and test runners are in that published artifact, not in your Git repo.

⸻

✅ 2. Karate Tests Packaged in a Snapshot Jar

If a previous team uploaded a Karate test suite as a SNAPSHOT JAR to Artifactory, this pom.xml could be:
	•	a test runner module, or
	•	a thin wrapper to download that JAR and execute tests.

⸻

✅ 3. Surefire or Failsafe Plugin in pom.xml Triggers Tests Automatically

Check for this:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.2</version>
  <configuration>
    <includes>
      <include>**/*Test.java</include>
    </includes>
  </configuration>
</plugin>

If the tests are in a dependency, Surefire will discover and execute test runners from that JAR during mvn test.

⸻

✅ 4. Bamboo Plan Might Download Another Repo or Artifact

Even if this repo is empty, the Bamboo plan might:
	•	Clone another Git repo that contains the tests
	•	Use curl/wget to download a test JAR from Artifactory
	•	Call mvn verify or mvn test which runs the tests from the downloaded dependency

⸻

🛠️ What You Can Do Right Now

👉 Step 1: Open pom.xml and check for dependencies

Are there any -SNAPSHOT or internal artifact dependencies like:

<groupId>com.company.qa</groupId>
<artifactId>test-suite</artifactId>
<version>1.2.3-SNAPSHOT</version>

If yes, then tests live inside that JAR.

⸻

👉 Step 2: Look for Surefire or Failsafe plugins

These plugins are what run JUnit / Karate tests. Check if any are configured.

⸻

👉 Step 3: Check Bamboo Build Logs

Look at the Bamboo plan logs:
	•	Is it cloning more than one repo?
	•	Is it downloading any JARs?
	•	What does the mvn command look like?
	•	Are .feature files shown in the logs?

⸻

👉 Step 4: Ask: Is This a Wrapper Repo?

This Git repo might just exist:
	•	to define a test suite through dependencies
	•	and run it in CI/CD without holding any real test code

⸻

📦 Example: Karate Tests Pulled From Artifactory

Let’s say this pom.xml is the only file:

<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.company.automation</groupId>
  <artifactId>qa-karate-runner</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.company.qa</groupId>
      <artifactId>karate-test-suite</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

Then mvn test will:
	•	Download the karate-test-suite from Artifactory
	•	Run the test classes defined in that JAR

✅ Want Help Reverse-Engineering It?

If you share your pom.xml content (even partially), I can:
	•	Tell you if it’s pulling tests from somewhere
	•	Show exactly how the tests are being executed
	•	Recreate the logic locally or in another Bamboo plan

Just paste your pom.xml, and I’ll explain how it’s being used.
