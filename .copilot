To reverse engineer a Maven project with only a pom.xml using GitHub Copilot, here’s how you can effectively leverage Copilot along with a structured manual approach:

⸻

🔧 Goal:

Use GitHub Copilot to understand:
	•	What the pom.xml is doing
	•	Where dependencies come from
	•	How tests are run (even without seeing any test files)

⸻

✅ Step-by-Step Guide Using GitHub Copilot

⸻

✅ 1. Create a Local Git Repo

Clone or create a repo locally (e.g. from Bamboo Git):

git clone <your-git-repo-url>
cd <repo>

If it contains only pom.xml, that’s fine.

⸻

✅ 2. Open in VSCode + GitHub Copilot

Ensure you have:
	•	GitHub Copilot extension installed
	•	Logged into GitHub Copilot
	•	A terminal inside VSCode (or external shell)

⸻

✅ 3. Ask Copilot Inline in a Comment

Open pom.xml and write a comment like this:

<!-- What is this pom.xml doing? Explain dependencies and plugins -->

Copilot will generate an explanation inline, often including:
	•	Purpose of each dependency
	•	What plugins are configured (e.g., Surefire, Shade)
	•	If tests are likely to be pulled from dependencies

⸻

✅ 4. Try Prompting Copilot for Reverse Engineering

Open a new file like reverse-engineer.md or analyze.js and write:

# Reverse Engineering pom.xml

This Maven project contains only a pom.xml with no test sources. What could be the source of tests?

## pom.xml summary:

Then paste the contents of pom.xml.

Now add:

## Questions:
1. Does it depend on any SNAPSHOTs?
2. Could tests be downloaded from Artifactory?
3. What plugins will execute?
4. What happens if I run `mvn test`?

Copilot will auto-complete with hypotheses.

⸻

✅ 5. Ask in a Java Class for More Context

If you’re still unsure, create a Java class like:

// File: AnalyzeTests.java

// What test classes will be discovered and executed when running mvn test
// based on this pom.xml? Assume test code might be in dependencies.

Copilot will try to analyze test discovery behavior.

⸻

🧠 Bonus: Manual + Copilot Combo

You can do this for better reverse engineering:

Task	Action
Identify dependencies	Ask Copilot to describe each dependency
Find plugins used	Copilot will explain Surefire/Failsafe use
Trace artifact origins	Copilot can infer Artifactory URLs if hints
Explore SNAPSHOT sources	Ask Copilot: “Where does this SNAPSHOT come from?”
Simulate mvn lifecycle	Ask Copilot: “What happens during mvn verify?”


⸻

📌 Example Copilot Prompt in VSCode

<!-- This dependency points to an internal test suite -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mycompany.qa</groupId>
  <artifactId>karate-tests</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Ask Copilot: -->
<!-- Where is this artifact likely hosted? Does it include test classes or feature files? -->

Copilot may generate:

“This artifact is likely hosted on a company’s internal Artifactory under the snapshots repository. If it contains test classes, and if the Surefire plugin is active, mvn test will automatically execute those tests.”

⸻

🚀 Tip: Combine with Maven CLI

mvn dependency:tree

Then ask Copilot:

# Here's the dependency tree. Which one contains test logic?


⸻

✅ Summary

GitHub Copilot is great for reverse engineering when combined with smart prompts:
	•	Use pom.xml comments
	•	Use .md files to write out your questions
	•	Let Copilot fill in hypotheses
	•	Ask specific questions inline (“where is this SNAPSHOT coming from?”)
