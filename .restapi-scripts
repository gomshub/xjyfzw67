Hereâ€™s a PowerShell script that demonstrates how to obtain an API key by sending a username and password to an endpoint, use that API key to make a request, and handle the scenario where the API key expires (getting a new one as needed).

This script assumes the following:
- `AUTH_ENDPOINT`: The API endpoint for logging in.
- `DATA_ENDPOINT`: The API endpoint where the data or file is retrieved from.
- It saves the API key in memory and makes a new login request when a 401 (Unauthorized) response is received.

```powershell
# Variables for API endpoints and credentials
$auth_endpoint = "https://example.com/api/login"
$data_endpoint = "https://example.com/api/data"
$username = "your_username"
$password = "your_password"

# Function to get a new API key
function Get-ApiKey {
    Write-Output "Fetching new API key..."

    # Prepare the body for the login request
    $body = @{
        username = $username
        password = $password
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    # Make the login request
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $auth_endpoint -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body

    # Extract the API key from the response
    $apiKey = $response.apiKey

    # Check if the API key was successfully retrieved
    if ($apiKey) {
        Write-Output "API key obtained."
        return $apiKey
    } else {
        Write-Error "Failed to obtain API key."
        exit 1
    }
}

# Function to make a request with the API key
function Make-Request {
    param (
        [string]$apiKey
    )

    # Prepare the headers with the API key
    $headers = @{
        Authorization = "Bearer $apiKey"
    }

    # Make the data request
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $data_endpoint -Method Get -Headers $headers -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    # Check if the API key is expired (401 Unauthorized)
    if ($response.StatusCode -eq 401) {
        Write-Output "API key expired. Fetching a new API key..."
        $apiKey = Get-ApiKey
        Make-Request -apiKey $apiKey  # Retry with the new API key
    } else {
        # Save the response (assuming it's a file or some data you want to store in output.txt)
        Write-Output "Request successful. Saving output to output.txt."
        $response | Out-File "output.txt"
    }
}

# Main script logic
# First, get a new API key
$apiKey = Get-ApiKey

# Make the request with the API key
Make-Request -apiKey $apiKey
```

### Explanation:
1. **`Get-ApiKey`**: This function logs in to the API by sending the username and password to the login endpoint. It extracts the API key from the JSON response and returns it.
2. **`Make-Request`**: This function makes the request to retrieve data using the API key. If it receives a 401 status code (indicating the key is expired), it logs in again to fetch a new key and retries the request.
3. **Main Logic**: The script first fetches the API key, then makes a request to get the output file or data. If the API key is expired, it automatically fetches a new one.

### Notes:
- `Invoke-RestMethod` is used for making API calls.
- `ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` ensures that the script doesn't stop execution due to an error, allowing us to check the status code and retry if necessary.

Replace the `auth_endpoint`, `data_endpoint`, and credentials (`$username`, `$password`) with actual values as per your API.

This script will work in Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core.
