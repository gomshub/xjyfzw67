Yes, the Python code I provided:
	•	Calculates the total size of the specified folder (prefix).
	•	Recursively includes all subfolders under that prefix.
	•	Counts all files (objects) within the folder and its subfolders.

How it works:

The line:

for page in paginator.paginate(Bucket=bucket_name, Prefix=prefix):

ensures that all objects with keys starting with the prefix (i.e., the folder path) are included — effectively covering the folder and all of its subfolders.

Example:

If you call:

get_folder_size('my-bucket', 'data/')

And your S3 bucket has:

data/file1.csv
data/file2.csv
data/subfolder1/file3.csv
data/subfolder1/nested/file4.csv

The script will:
	•	Count all 4 files
	•	Sum their sizes
	•	Return total size and count

Would you like a version that dynamically discovers top-level folders in a bucket and prints sizes for each?
