🔗 Outlook Sync
	•	Right-click any row → Outlook Tasks → pick Today/Tomorrow/Next Week.
	•	Task syncs into Outlook and Microsoft To Do with reminders.
	•	Completion syncs both ways (check in Outlook → auto-check in OneNote).

⸻

🔄 Weekly Workflow
	•	Monday morning → Pull 2–3 items from This Week → Monday table, flag urgent ones to Outlook.
	•	Daily → Update Status (⏳ / ⛔ / ✅ / 🔜) + add notes.
	•	Friday afternoon → Move unfinished items to Next Week page.
	•	Review “Later” list once a week → promote if needed.

⸻

✨ With this setup:
	•	Each day has its own sectioned table (great for JIRA + notes).
	•	You keep rolling tasks forward (Method 2).
	•	Important tasks get synced into Outlook for reminders (Method 3).

⸻

👉 Do you want me to also prepare this as a OneNote template file (.onepkg) that you can import directly instead of copy-pasting tables every time?


Perfect 👍 Let’s build both for you:

⸻

🟢 Option 1: Method 2 (Rolling To-Do) with JIRA + Status in OneNote

Here’s a template table you can copy into OneNote to track tasks in a Kanban-style format:

✅	Task	JIRA ID	Status	Notes
[ ]	Fix ECS deployment error	JIRA-1234	⏳ In Progress	Debugging Terraform ALB module
[ ]	Add RabbitMQ queue arguments	JIRA-5678	⛔ On Hold	Waiting for product team input
[ ]	Automate S3-to-Lambda pipeline	JIRA-7890	🔜 Not Started	Terraform IAM roles needed


⸻

🔹 How to use this table:
	•	✅ Column = OneNote checkbox (Ctrl+1) → tick when done.
	•	Task = Short description.
	•	JIRA ID = Hyperlink to ticket.
	•	Status = Use emojis or plain text (⏳ In Progress / ⛔ On Hold / ✅ Completed / 🔜 Not Started).
	•	Notes = Extra context.

👉 You can have three tables (Today / This Week / Later) on the same page for rolling tracking.

⸻

🟢 Option 2: Method 2 + Method 3 (OneNote + Outlook Integration)

This combo lets you:
	•	Organize tasks in OneNote (Method 2).
	•	Send selected tasks into Outlook for reminders & mobile sync (Method 3).

⸻

🔹 Step 1: Rolling To-Do in OneNote

Keep the same table as above, OR just a bulleted list:

🔴 Today
[ ] [JIRA-1234] Fix ECS deployment error – ⏳ In Progress
[ ] [JIRA-5678] Add RabbitMQ queue arguments – ⛔ On Hold

🟡 This Week
[ ] [JIRA-7890] Automate S3-to-Lambda pipeline – 🔜 Not Started


⸻

🔹 Step 2: Send Important Tasks to Outlook
	1.	Right-click a task in OneNote → Outlook Tasks.
	2.	Pick due date (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, Custom Date).
	3.	The task gets a red flag + syncs into Outlook Tasks / Microsoft To Do.
	•	You get reminders.
	•	If you check it off in Outlook/To Do → it updates in OneNote automatically.

⸻

🔹 Step 3: Daily Flow
	•	Morning → Move 2–3 items from This Week → Today. Flag urgent ones to Outlook for reminders.
	•	During the day → Update status in OneNote (⏳/⛔/✅).
	•	End of day → Check off completed tasks in Outlook & OneNote, move pending tasks forward.

⸻

✅ Benefit:
	•	OneNote = your planning hub (organized by JIRA + status + notes).
	•	Outlook = your execution tool (reminders, mobile sync, calendar view).

⸻

👉 Do you want me to prepare a ready-to-paste OneNote daily template (with the three sections + JIRA/status table + Outlook task flags) so you can literally drop it into your office OneNote and start tomorrow?
