To get the resource specifications (such as CPU and memory capacity) of a node in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool. Here are a few common commands to retrieve this information:

### 1. Describing a Node
The `kubectl describe node <node-name>` command provides detailed information about a specific node, including its resource capacity and allocation.

```sh
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node you want to inspect. This command outputs comprehensive details about the node, including resource capacities, allocatable resources, and current usage.

### 2. Getting Node Details in JSON or YAML Format
To get detailed resource specifications in a more structured format, you can use the `kubectl get` command with the `-o` option to output in JSON or YAML format.

#### JSON Output
```sh
kubectl get node <node-name> -o json
```

#### YAML Output
```sh
kubectl get node <node-name> -o yaml
```

This provides all the details about the node, including capacity and allocatable resources.

### 3. Using `kubectl top` to View Resource Usage
The `kubectl top` command shows the current resource usage of nodes and pods. This requires the Metrics Server to be installed in your cluster.

```sh
kubectl top node <node-name>
```

This command provides a summary of the current CPU and memory usage for the specified node.

### Example: Detailed Steps

1. **List All Nodes**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   This lists all the nodes in the cluster along with their statuses.

2. **Describe a Specific Node**:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe node <node-name>
   ```

   This gives detailed information about the node, including its resource specifications.

3. **Get Node Details in JSON**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get node <node-name> -o json
   ```

   This outputs the node's details in JSON format, from which you can extract the resource information.

4. **Get Node Resource Usage**:
   ```sh
   kubectl top node <node-name>
   ```

   This shows the current CPU and memory usage of the node.

### Key Sections to Look For

- **Capacity**: Indicates the total resources available on the node.
- **Allocatable**: Indicates the resources available for pods after reserving resources for system processes.
- **Usage**: Current resource usage by the node.

#### Example Output (YAML)

Here is a snippet from the `kubectl get node <node-name> -o yaml` output showing capacity and allocatable resources:

```yaml
status:
  capacity:
    cpu: "16"
    memory: 64349236Ki
    pods: "110"
  allocatable:
    cpu: "16"
    memory: 64349236Ki
    pods: "110"
```

This indicates the node has 16 CPUs, approximately 64 GB of memory, and a maximum of 110 pods.

### Conclusion

Using these commands, you can effectively retrieve and understand the resource specifications and usage of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. This information is crucial for managing resource allocation, troubleshooting, and optimizing cluster performance.
