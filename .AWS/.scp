Short JIRA Comment

Thanks for enabling the mandatory KMS key for S3 writes in eu-central-1 — CRR replication from eu-west-1 → eu-central-1 is now working.

However, direct failover uploads to eu-central-1 still fail when using the IAM tech user via S3 VPC endpoint (AWS CLI / boto3).

CloudTrail shows:
	•	kms:GenerateDataKey success
	•	No s3:PutObject events

This strongly suggests an SCP restriction on S3 actions or regional access (eu-central-1), not IAM, bucket policy, VPCE, or KMS.

Request:
Please verify/update the SCP to allow direct S3 writes to eu-central-1 for the tech user (failover scenario).

Minimal SCP Allow Snippet (Failover Only)

{
  "Sid": "AllowFailoverS3PutEuCentral1",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
    },
    "ArnNotEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:user/tech-user"
    }
  }
}

✅ Keeps eu-west-1 as primary
✅ Allows eu-central-1 only for failover
✅ No broad S3 exposure

One-line takeaway (for infra)

KMS authorization succeeds, but S3 never receives the request — this is consistent with an SCP deny on S3 regional access.

If you want, I can also give:
	•	SCP version scoped to VPCE only
	•	SCP allowing PutObject + ListBucket only
	•	AWS CLI command infra can use to prove SCP deny

Just say.
