Setting up MongoDB involves several steps, including installation, configuration, and starting the MongoDB server. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up MongoDB on a Linux-based system:

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

#### Step 1.1: Import MongoDB Public Key

1. Open a terminal.

2. Import the MongoDB public GPG key:
   ```bash
   wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-5.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

#### Step 1.2: Create MongoDB Repository

1. Create the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list` file:
   ```bash
   echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/5.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list
   ```

#### Step 1.3: Install MongoDB

1. Update the package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install the MongoDB packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
   ```

### Step 2: Start MongoDB Service

1. Start the MongoDB service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

2. Enable MongoDB to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```

### Step 3: Verify MongoDB Installation

1. Check the MongoDB service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```

2. Verify that MongoDB has started successfully and is running.

### Step 4: Access MongoDB Shell

1. Open the MongoDB shell by typing:
   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

2. You will be connected to the MongoDB shell, where you can start interacting with the MongoDB server.

### Step 5: Configure MongoDB (Optional)

1. MongoDB configuration file is located at `/etc/mongod.conf`.
   - You can modify settings such as the data directory, log settings, and network settings in this file.

2. Make any necessary changes to the configuration file and restart the MongoDB service for the changes to take effect:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mongod
   ```

### Step 6: Secure MongoDB (Optional)

1. Configure authentication:
   - Follow the MongoDB documentation to create users and enable authentication for your MongoDB deployment.

2. Configure network access control:
   - Restrict access to MongoDB by configuring network settings in the MongoDB configuration file.

### Step 7: Begin Using MongoDB

1. You can now begin using MongoDB by creating databases, collections, and documents through the MongoDB shell or using MongoDB drivers in your applications.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up MongoDB on your Linux-based system. You can now start using MongoDB to store and manage your data. Make sure to refer to the MongoDB documentation for more advanced configurations and best practices.
