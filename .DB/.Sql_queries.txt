Excluding the objec_type creation  for the object_id 2 and 3 , and excluding a list of object_id  , delete all other rows for 2017 
DELETE FROM data_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date) = 2017
  AND NOT (
    (object_id IN (2, 3) AND object_type = 'creation')
    OR object_id IN (5, 6, 7)
  );



to append prefix:

To update a field value on a table with a prefix using Oracle SQL, you can use the `UPDATE` statement with the `CONCAT` function to concatenate the prefix with the existing field value. Here's an example:

Let's say you have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

| employee_id | first_name | last_name |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1           | John       | Doe       |
| 2           | Jane       | Smith     |
| 3           | Mark       | Johnson   |

And you want to update the `first_name` column by adding a prefix "Mr." to each first name. You can use the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET first_name = CONCAT('Mr.', first_name);
```

After running this query, the `employees` table will be updated as follows:

| employee_id | first_name | last_name |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1           | Mr. John   | Doe       |
| 2           | Mr. Jane   | Smith     |
| 3           | Mr. Mark   | Johnson   |

In this example, the `CONCAT` function is used to concatenate the prefix "Mr." with the existing `first_name` value for each row, and the result is assigned back to the `first_name` column using the `SET` clause in the `UPDATE` statement.

to remove suffix from a field:

To update a field value on a table and remove a suffix using Oracle SQL, you can use the `UPDATE` statement along with the `SUBSTR` and `INSTR` functions. Here's an example:

Let's assume you have a table called `products` with the following structure:

| product_id | product_name     |
|------------|-----------------|
| 1          | Apple iPhone Xs  |
| 2          | Samsung Galaxy S9|
| 3          | Google Pixel 3   |

Suppose you want to update the `product_name` column by removing the suffix "Xs" from the product names. You can use the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET product_name = SUBSTR(product_name, 1, INSTR(product_name, 'Xs') - 1)
WHERE product_name LIKE '%Xs';
```

After running this query, the `products` table will be updated as follows:

| product_id | product_name       |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1          | Apple iPhone      |
| 2          | Samsung Galaxy S9 |
| 3          | Google Pixel 3    |

In this example, the `UPDATE` statement updates the `product_name` column by extracting a substring from the original value. The `SUBSTR` function is used to specify the start position and length of the substring. The `INSTR` function is used to locate the position of the suffix "Xs" within the `product_name` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to only update the ones that contain the suffix "Xs".



select distinct policy_id from user

select name, role, policy_id from user where policy_id=122

Certainly! Here's an example of a SELECT query that retrieves values from multiple related tables in Oracle DB and displays them in a single row:

```sql
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2, t3.column3, t4.column4
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.related_column = t2.related_column
JOIN table3 t3 ON t2.related_column = t3.related_column
JOIN table4 t4 ON t3.related_column = t4.related_column
WHERE t1.condition = 'value';
```

In this example, you would replace "table1", "table2", "table3", and "table4" with the actual names of your tables. Also, "column1", "column2", "column3", and "column4" should be replaced with the specific column names you want to retrieve from each table.

The "related_column" is the column that establishes the relationship between the tables. You'll need to identify and specify the correct columns in your database schema.

Lastly, "t1.condition = 'value'" represents a condition that filters the rows based on a specific value. You can modify this part of the query to suit your requirements.

Please note that this is a generic example, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific table and column names, as well as the relationships established between them.



sql
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2, t3.column3, ..., t10.column10
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.foreign_key2 = t2.primary_key
JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.foreign_key3 = t3.primary_key
...
JOIN table10 t10 ON t1.foreign_key10 = t10.primary_key
WHERE t1.foreign_key1 = 'desired_value';





sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE TO_CHAR(date_column, 'YY') = '17';



sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) LIKE '%YY';



Certainly! To efficiently delete rows of a particular year in a large table in Oracle DB, you can use subsets or cursor-based approach. Here's an example of both methods:

Using Subsets:
```sql
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) = 2022;
```
In this example, `your_table` is the name of your table, and `date_column` is the column that contains the date you want to filter. Replace these with your actual table and column names. The `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column)` function extracts the year from the date and compares it with the desired year (2022 in this case). This approach directly deletes the matching rows without using cursors.

Using Cursors:
```sql
DECLARE
  CURSOR c1 IS
    SELECT *
    FROM your_table
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) = 2022;
BEGIN
  FOR r1 IN c1 LOOP
    DELETE FROM your_table WHERE CURRENT OF c1;
  END LOOP;
  COMMIT;
END;
```
In this example, a cursor named `c1` is defined to select the rows that match the desired year. Then, a loop is used to iterate over each row fetched by the cursor, and the `DELETE` statement is executed for each row using the `CURRENT OF` clause. Finally, the `COMMIT` statement is used to save the changes.

Please note that before running any delete operation, it's essential to have a backup of your data or perform a thorough validation to ensure that you are deleting the correct rows.

To delete rows from all relational tables for a specific year using an SQL procedure, you can use dynamic SQL to generate and execute the necessary DELETE statements. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteRowsByYear (@targetYear INT)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @tableName NVARCHAR(128);
    DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX);

    -- Cursor to loop through all tables in the database
    DECLARE tableCursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT TABLE_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE';

    -- Temporary table to store the DELETE statements
    CREATE TABLE #DeleteStatements
    (
        Statement NVARCHAR(MAX)
    );

    OPEN tableCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM tableCursor INTO @tableName;

    -- Loop through each table and generate DELETE statements
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        SET @sql = N'DELETE FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@tableName) + N' WHERE YEAR(order_date) = @targetYear;';
        INSERT INTO #DeleteStatements (Statement) VALUES (@sql);

        FETCH NEXT FROM tableCursor INTO @tableName;
    END;

    CLOSE tableCursor;
    DEALLOCATE tableCursor;

    -- Execute the generated DELETE statements
    DECLARE @deleteSql NVARCHAR(MAX);
    DECLARE deleteCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT Statement FROM #DeleteStatements;

    OPEN deleteCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM deleteCursor INTO @deleteSql;

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        EXEC sp_executesql @deleteSql, N'@targetYear INT', @targetYear;

        FETCH NEXT FROM deleteCursor INTO @deleteSql;
    END;

    CLOSE deleteCursor;
    DEALLOCATE deleteCursor;

    -- Clean up temporary table
    DROP TABLE #DeleteStatements;
END;
```

In this example, the procedure loops through all the base tables in the database using a cursor. For each table, it generates a dynamic DELETE statement based on the table name and the year condition. The generated DELETE statements are stored in a temporary table. Finally, the procedure executes each DELETE statement using another cursor.

To use this procedure, you can call it by passing the desired year as an argument:

```sql
EXEC DeleteRowsByYear @targetYear = 2022;
```

This will generate and execute DELETE statements for all the base tables in the database, deleting rows where the specified year condition is met.

Please note that this example assumes that the tables have a column named `order_date` that represents the date or year information. You may need to modify the code to match your specific table structure and column names. Also, be cautious when executing such a procedure as it will delete data from all tables, so make sure to have proper backups and test it thoroughly before running it in a production environment.

To delete rows for certain years in multiple tables efficiently using an SQL procedure, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an SQL procedure that performs the deletion operations for each table. The procedure should accept the year as a parameter.

2. Identify the tables that contain the data you want to delete rows from.

3. Determine the condition for selecting rows based on the specific year you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete rows for the year 2022, the condition could be something like `YEAR(date_column) = 2022`.

4. Write an SQL DELETE statement for each table within the procedure, specifying the condition to delete rows for the desired year. Here's an example:

   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteRowsForYear(year_param INT)
   BEGIN
     DELETE FROM table1
     WHERE YEAR(date_column) = year_param;
     
     DELETE FROM table2
     WHERE YEAR(date_column) = year_param;
     
     -- Repeat the DELETE statement for each table you identified
   END;
   ```

   Repeat the DELETE statement for each table you identified in step 2, ensuring that you adjust the table name and the condition accordingly.

5. Execute the SQL procedure by passing the desired year as a parameter. This will trigger the deletion of rows for that year in multiple tables.

By using an SQL procedure, you can execute the delete statements for multiple tables sequentially within a single procedure call. However, keep in mind that this approach performs the deletions sequentially rather than in parallel. If you want to execute the delete operations in parallel, you may need to employ other techniques specific to your database system, such as using multiple database connections or threads to execute the procedure concurrently.
