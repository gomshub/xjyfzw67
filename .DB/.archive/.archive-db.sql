Yes, you can archive historical data from specific heavy tables in the main database to the archive database on a weekly basis before purging the data from the main database. Here is a detailed approach to achieve this:

### 1. **Identify Heavy Tables and Define Archiving Criteria**
- Identify the heavy tables that need to be archived.
- Define the criteria for what constitutes historical data (e.g., data older than 6 months).

### 2. **Prepare the Archive Database**
- Ensure the archive database is set up and accessible.
- Create tables in the archive database that mirror the schema of the heavy tables in the main database or are optimized for archival purposes.

### 3. **Create Archiving Scripts for Each Table**
- Write scripts to automate the extraction, loading, and purging of data for each heavy table.

### Example for a Table Named `transactions`

#### SQL Script (`archive_transactions.sql`):
```sql
-- Step 1: Insert old data into the archive database
INSERT INTO archive_db.archived_transactions
SELECT * FROM main_db.transactions
WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

-- Step 2: Verify data transfer (optional, add checks as needed)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM archive_db.archived_transactions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM main_db.transactions WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

-- Step 3: Delete old data from the main database
DELETE FROM main_db.transactions WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);
```

### 4. **Create a Shell Script to Run the SQL Scripts**
- Create a shell script to run the SQL scripts for each heavy table.

#### Shell Script (`archive_heavy_tables.sh`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Archive transactions table
mysql -u username -p password -h hostname -D main_db < /path/to/archive_transactions.sql

# Log the operation
echo "Archiving transactions completed on $(date)" >> /path/to/archive_log.txt

# Add similar commands for other heavy tables
# Example: mysql -u username -p password -h hostname -D main_db < /path/to/archive_another_table.sql
```

### 5. **Schedule the Shell Script**
- Use `cron` or another scheduling tool to run the shell script weekly.

#### Using `cron` on Unix-based Systems:
```sh
# Open crontab
crontab -e

# Add the following line to schedule the script every Sunday at midnight
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/archive_heavy_tables.sh
```

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Set up monitoring to ensure the archiving process runs successfully.
- Configure alerts (e.g., email notifications) in case of failures.

### Example for Multiple Heavy Tables
If you have multiple heavy tables, you can extend the shell script to include additional SQL scripts:

#### Extended Shell Script (`archive_heavy_tables.sh`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Archive transactions table
mysql -u username -p password -h hostname -D main_db < /path/to/archive_transactions.sql

# Archive another heavy table
mysql -u username -p password -h hostname -D main_db < /path/to/archive_another_table.sql

# Log the operation
echo "Archiving completed on $(date)" >> /path/to/archive_log.txt
```

### Best Practices
- **Incremental Backups**: Take backups before running the archiving process.
- **Data Validation**: Include checks to validate that data has been successfully copied and removed.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling in scripts to manage failures gracefully.
- **Security**: Ensure that database credentials are securely managed and not hard-coded in scripts.

By following these steps, you can automate the weekly archiving of historical data from specific heavy tables in your main database to your archive database, ensuring efficient and consistent data management.

Yes, historical data can be archived weekly from the main database to an archive database in an automated way. Here is a detailed plan to achieve this:

### 1. **Define Archiving Criteria**
- Determine what qualifies as historical data (e.g., data older than 6 months).
- Specify the archiving schedule (e.g., every Sunday at midnight).

### 2. **Prepare Archive Database**
- Ensure the archive database is set up and accessible.
- Mirror the schema of the primary database tables or design a schema optimized for archival purposes.

### 3. **Write Archiving Script**
- Create a script to automate the extraction, transformation (if needed), and loading (ETL) of data.
- The script should:
  - Extract data that meets the archiving criteria.
  - Insert extracted data into the archive database.
  - Verify the data transfer.
  - Delete the data from the primary database if verification is successful.

### 4. **Schedule the Script**
- Use a scheduling tool like `cron` on Unix-based systems, Windows Task Scheduler, or a database job scheduler to run the script weekly.

### Example Using SQL and Shell Script

#### SQL Script (`archive_data.sql`):
```sql
-- Step 1: Insert old data into archive database
INSERT INTO archive_db.archived_transactions
SELECT * FROM primary_db.transactions
WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

-- Step 2: Verify data transfer (optional, add checks as needed)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM archive_db.archived_transactions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM primary_db.transactions WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);

-- Step 3: Delete old data from primary database
DELETE FROM primary_db.transactions WHERE transaction_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);
```

#### Shell Script (`archive_weekly.sh`):
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Run the SQL script
mysql -u username -p password -h hostname -D primary_db < /path/to/archive_data.sql

# Log the operation
echo "Archiving completed on $(date)" >> /path/to/archive_log.txt
```

### 5. **Schedule the Shell Script**
- On Unix-based systems, use `cron` to schedule the shell script.

```sh
# Open crontab
crontab -e

# Add the following line to schedule the script every Sunday at midnight
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/archive_weekly.sh
```

- On Windows, use Task Scheduler to create a new task that runs the shell script weekly.

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Set up monitoring to ensure the archiving process runs successfully.
- Configure alerts (e.g., email notifications) in case of failures.

### Best Practices
- **Incremental Backups**: Take backups before running the archiving process.

- **Error Handling**: Add error handling in scripts to manage failures gracefully.
- **Security**: Ensure that database credentials are securely managed and not hard-coded in scripts.
