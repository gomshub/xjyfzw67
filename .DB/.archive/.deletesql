To delete records from both the `Audit` (main) table and the `audit_link` (relational) table based on the criteria provided, you need to ensure that you delete the records in the correct order to maintain referential integrity. Hereâ€™s an approach using a stored procedure:

### SQL Procedure

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Delete_Old_Audit_And_Link IS
BEGIN
    -- Delete from the audit_link table first to avoid foreign key violations
    DELETE FROM audit_link al
    WHERE al.id IN (
        SELECT a.id
        FROM Audit a
        WHERE a.date_column < ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -12)
        AND al.object_type IN (3, 4, 5)
    );
    
    -- Delete from the Audit table
    DELETE FROM Audit a
    WHERE a.date_column < ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -12)
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM audit_link al
        WHERE al.id = a.id
        AND al.object_type IN (3, 4, 5)
    );
    
    -- Commit the transaction
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

### Explanation:

1. **Deleting from `audit_link`**:
   - First, we delete records from the `audit_link` table where the `id` matches the criteria in the `Audit` table. This ensures that no orphan records are left in `audit_link`.

2. **Deleting from `Audit`**:
   - Next, we delete the corresponding records from the `Audit` table. The `EXISTS` clause ensures that we only delete records from `Audit` where there was a matching record in `audit_link` with `object_type` 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Transaction Control**:
   - A `COMMIT` is issued at the end to finalize the deletions.

### Execution

To execute the procedure:

```sql
BEGIN
    Delete_Old_Audit_And_Link;
END;
/
```

This will delete the relevant records from both the `Audit` and `audit_link` tables based on your criteria.
