Yes, if the archive database tables are created with partitioning, compression, and indexing, you can load the extracted CSV files without requiring transformation. However, there are several considerations and best practices to ensure a smooth data load process:

### Considerations and Best Practices

1. **Partitioning**:
    - Ensure that the data being loaded aligns with the partitioning scheme.
    - For instance, if your table is partitioned by date, the data should include the date columns used for partitioning.

2. **Compression**:
    - Compression is managed at the storage level and should not interfere with data loading. However, it might slightly impact the speed due to the compression process.

3. **Indexing**:
    - Indexes can slow down the data load process because the database must maintain the indexes as data is inserted.
    - Consider disabling or dropping indexes before loading large volumes of data and then recreating them afterward.

### Steps to Load Data into Partitioned, Compressed, and Indexed Tables

#### Example of Creating a Partitioned and Compressed Table

Assume you are using MySQL. Here's how you might create a partitioned and compressed table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE archived_orders (
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, order_date)
) ENGINE=InnoDB
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) (
    PARTITION p2017 VALUES LESS THAN (2018),
    PARTITION p2018 VALUES LESS THAN (2019),
    PARTITION p2019 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p2020 VALUES LESS THAN (2021)
)
ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED
KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;

CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON archived_orders (customer_id);
```

#### Loading Data into the Partitioned Table

Use the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command to load data from CSV files:

```sh
# Load orders data into the partitioned table
mysql -u $ARCHIVE_USER -p$ARCHIVE_PASS -h $ARCHIVE_HOST -D $ARCHIVE_DB -e "
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/orders_2017-01.csv'
INTO TABLE archived_orders
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
"

# Repeat for other months...
```

#### Managing Indexes for Efficient Data Loading

To improve performance during large data loads, you might want to disable and re-enable indexes:

```sql
-- Disable indexes
ALTER TABLE archived_orders DISABLE KEYS;

-- Load data
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/orders_2017-01.csv'
INTO TABLE archived_orders
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

-- Re-enable indexes
ALTER TABLE archived_orders ENABLE KEYS;
```

### Automating the Archival Process

Here is an enhanced shell script that automates the extraction, loading, and verification process while managing indexes:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Database connection details
MAIN_USER="main_username"
MAIN_PASS="main_password"
MAIN_HOST="main_db_host"
MAIN_DB="main_db"

ARCHIVE_USER="archive_username"
ARCHIVE_PASS="archive_password"
ARCHIVE_HOST="archive_db_host"
ARCHIVE_DB="archive_db"

# Email notification details
EMAIL="your-email@example.com"

# File to keep track of the current archival period
ARCHIVE_STATE_FILE="/path/to/archive_state.txt"

# Check if archive state file exists, if not create it starting from 2017-01
if [ ! -f $ARCHIVE_STATE_FILE ]; then
    echo "2017-01" > $ARCHIVE_STATE_FILE
fi

# Read the current archival period from the file
CURRENT_PERIOD=$(cat $ARCHIVE_STATE_FILE)
CURRENT_YEAR=$(echo $CURRENT_PERIOD | cut -d'-' -f1)
CURRENT_MONTH=$(echo $CURRENT_PERIOD | cut -d'-' -f2)

# Determine the next period
NEXT_YEAR=$CURRENT_YEAR
NEXT_MONTH=$(($CURRENT_MONTH + 1))

if [ $NEXT_MONTH -gt 12 ]; then
    NEXT_MONTH=1
    NEXT_YEAR=$(($NEXT_YEAR + 1))
fi

NEXT_PERIOD=$(printf "%04d-%02d" $NEXT_YEAR $NEXT_MONTH)

# Archival range
START_DATE="${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-01"
END_DATE="${NEXT_YEAR}-${NEXT_MONTH}-01"

# File paths for data extraction
ORDERS_FILE="/path/to/orders_${CURRENT_PERIOD}.csv"
ORDER_ITEMS_FILE="/path/to/order_items_${CURRENT_PERIOD}.csv"

# Extract data from main database to CSV files

")

if [ "$MAIN_COUNT_ORDERS" -eq "$ARCHIVE_COUNT_ORDERS" ] && [ "$MAIN_COUNT_ORDER_ITEMS" -eq "$ARCHIVE_COUNT_ORDER_ITEMS" ]; then
    # Purge data from main database
    mysql -u $MAIN_USER -p$MAIN_PASS -h $MAIN_HOST -D $MAIN_DB -e "
    DELETE FROM order_items
    WHERE order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '$START_DATE' AND order_date < '$END_DATE');
    "

    mysql -u $MAIN_USER -p$MAIN_PASS -h $MAIN_HOST -D $MAIN_DB -e "
    DELETE FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '$START_DATE' AND order_date < '$END_DATE';
    "
else
    echo "Archival verification failed for period $CURRENT_PERIOD." | mail -s "Archival Process Failed" $EMAIL
    exit 1
fi

# Update the archive state file with the next period
echo $NEXT_PERIOD > $ARCHIVE_STATE_FILE

# Check if the archival process is complete (reached 2020-01)
if [ "$NEXT_PERIOD" == "2020-01" ]; then
    # Send email notification
    echo "Archival process completed." | mail -s "Archival Process Completed" $EMAIL

    # Remove the cron job (assumes the script is scheduled as a daily cron job)
    crontab -l | grep -v '/path/to/daily_archive.sh' | crontab -
fi
```

### Summary

- **Partitioning** and **compression** will not interfere with loading data from CSV files.
- **Indexes** can be temporarily disabled to speed up the data load process and then re-enabled afterward.
- **Automate** the process using a shell script and **cron jobs** for regular execution.
- **Verify** data integrity by comparing row counts before purging data from the main database.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the archival process while ensuring data integrity and optimizing performance.
