Subject: Request for CSA Support on GIS Approval – New AWS S3 Account

Hi [CSA’s Name],

We’ve been requested to create a new AWS S3 account for the [Product/Project Name]. As part of the process, GIS approval is required before proceeding.

Could you please help us with:
	•	Reviewing the proposed setup to ensure it aligns with cloud security and compliance requirements.
	•	Providing any necessary inputs or documentation that GIS typically expects for such requests.
	•	Supporting us in getting the GIS approval finalized.

This will help us ensure the S3 account is compliant from the start and avoid delays later.

Please let us know if you need any details from our side (e.g., use case, data classification, region, access model).

Thanks in advance for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Team/Department]

Would you like me to also add a short technical summary you can attach (e.g., intended use case, data type, encryption, access model) so the CSA has all the context right away?
