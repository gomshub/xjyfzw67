If the JIRA API isn’t returning the custom field ID for the Epic Link, it’s possible that the Epic Link field may not be directly accessible in your issue response. Here are several approaches to determine if an issue is linked to an Epic using the JIRA API:

Approach 1: Use JQL to Retrieve Epic Link Information

If you have permission to query JIRA using JQL (JIRA Query Language), you can use a query to get issues that are linked to a specific Epic or check if an issue has an Epic link.

	1.	Check if an Issue is Linked to an Epic: Use a JQL query to find the Epic link directly in JIRA.
Example:

curl -u username:password -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=key=ISSUE-123"

This will give you details about ISSUE-123. Check if an Epic Link field appears under fields in the response. If the issue has an Epic link, it should appear here, though sometimes JIRA’s response structure varies depending on configurations.

	2.	Identify Issues Linked to a Specific Epic: To find all issues linked to a specific Epic, use the Epic’s key in a JQL query:

curl -u username:password -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=\"Epic Link\"=EPIC-123"

This will return all issues that have an Epic Link to EPIC-123.

Approach 2: Use Issue Links to Identify Epic Connections

If JIRA does not use the Epic Link custom field but instead uses issue links to indicate relationships between issues, you can look for these links in the API response.

curl -u username:password -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/ISSUE-123"

In the JSON response, check the "fields" section for "issuelinks", which might look like this:

{
    "fields": {
        "issuelinks": [
            {
                "type": {
                    "name": "Epic-Story Link"
                },
                "inwardIssue": {
                    "key": "EPIC-123",
                    "fields": {
                        "summary": "Epic for Project X"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

In this case:

	•	"issuelinks" contains information on linked issues.
	•	"inwardIssue" or "outwardIssue" within each link object shows the key of the linked Epic.

Approach 3: Using the parent Field for Subtasks

If the issue is a subtask of an Epic, the parent field might be used instead of a direct Epic Link.

Example response:

{
    "fields": {
        "parent": {
            "key": "EPIC-123",
            "fields": {
                "summary": "Epic for Project Y"
            }
        }
    }
}

In this case, "parent" refers to the Epic if the issue is part of it directly.

Example Python Code to Check for Epic Link

Here’s an example in Python that checks for Epic linkage through various fields in the response:

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

def check_epic_link(jira_url, issue_key, username, password):
    response = requests.get(
        f"{jira_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{issue_key}",
        auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        fields = data.get("fields", {})
        
        # Check for the Epic Link custom field directly
        epic_link = fields.get("customfield_10008")  # Replace with the actual Epic Link field ID
        if epic_link:
            print(f"Epic Link: {epic_link}")
            return

        # Check for issuelinks field
        issuelinks = fields.get("issuelinks", [])
        for link in issuelinks:
            if link.get("type", {}).get("name") == "Epic-Story Link":
                epic_key = link.get("inwardIssue", {}).get("key") or link.get("outwardIssue", {}).get("key")
                if epic_key:
                    print(f"Epic Link found in issuelinks: {epic_key}")
                    return

        # Check if the issue is a subtask with a parent Epic
        parent = fields.get("parent")
        if parent:
            print(f"Epic Link found in parent field: {parent.get('key')}")
            return

        print("No Epic Link found for this issue.")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve issue: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

# Example usage
jira_url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
issue_key = "ISSUE-123"
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"

check_epic_link(jira_url, issue_key, username, password)

Summary

	1.	Use JQL to query Epic Links.
	2.	Check "issuelinks" for any Epic-related links.
	3.	Look at the "parent" field if the issue is a subtask.

These approaches will help you determine if an issue is linked to an Epic, even if the direct Epic Link custom field is unavailable in the JSON response.

In JIRA, the Epic Link is often stored in a custom field, and the field ID for it can vary depending on the JIRA configuration. If you don’t see customfield_10008 or similar, you can follow these steps to identify the exact field ID:

	1.	Retrieve All Fields to Identify the Epic Link Field:
First, retrieve all available fields to locate the custom field ID used for the Epic Link. Run this code to get a list of all fields in JIRA:

from jira import JIRA

def get_all_fields(jira_url, username, api_token):
    jira = JIRA(server=jira_url, basic_auth=(username, api_token))
    fields = jira.fields()

    # Search for 'Epic Link' in the list of fields
    for field in fields:
        if 'Epic Link' in field['name']:
            print(f"Field ID: {field['id']} - Field Name: {field['name']}")

# Example usage
jira_url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
username = "your-email@example.com"
api_token = "your-api-token"

get_all_fields(jira_url, username, api_token)

This code will print the ID of any field named “Epic Link.” Look for an ID like customfield_10008 or something similar.

	2.	Use the Epic Link Field ID in Your Code:
Once you’ve identified the field ID, update your original code to use this ID when accessing the Epic Link:

from jira import JIRA

def get_epic_link(issue_key, jira_url, username, api_token):
    jira = JIRA(server=jira_url, basic_auth=(username, api_token))
    
    try:
        issue = jira.issue(issue_key)
        
        # Replace with the identified Epic Link field ID
        epic_link = getattr(issue.fields, 'customfield_XXXX', None)  # Replace XXXX with actual ID

        return epic_link if epic_link else "Not OK"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return "Not OK"

# Example usage
jira_url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
username = "your-email@example.com"
api_token = "your-api-token"
issue_key = "PROJ-123"

print(get_epic_link(issue_key, jira_url, username, api_token))



Replace 'customfield_XXXX' with the actual field ID from the output of get_all_fields. If the Epic Link field is present, this code will return it; otherwise, it will return "Not OK".

To identify the owner and group name of files within subfolders under a directory, specifically for files owned by "testuser", you can use a combination of `find`, `ls`, or `stat` commands. Below are steps and command examples for identifying such files and their owner/group names in a Linux environment.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Navigate to the target directory**: Change to the directory containing the subfolders.
2. **Use `find` to locate files owned by `testuser`**: The `find` command can search recursively and filter files based on the owner.
3. **Display owner and group information**: Use `ls -l` or `stat` to display detailed information about the files.

### Example Commands

1. **Change to the target directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/target/directory
   ```

2. **Find files owned by `testuser` and display owner/group using `ls -l`**:
   ```sh
   find . -type f -user testuser -exec ls -l {} \;
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `find . -type f -user testuser`: Finds all files (`-type f`) owned by `testuser` within the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - `-exec ls -l {} \;`: Executes the `ls -l` command on each found file to display detailed information, including owner and group.

3. **Find files owned by `testuser` and display owner/group using `stat`**:
   ```sh
   find . -type f -user testuser -exec stat -c '%n %U %G' {} \;
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `find . -type f -user testuser`: Finds all files owned by `testuser`.
   - `-exec stat -c '%n %U %G' {} \;`: Executes the `stat` command with a custom format:
     - `%n`: File name
     - `%U`: Owner name
     - `%G`: Group name

### Explanation of Commands

- **`find`**: Searches for files in a directory hierarchy.
  - `.`: Specifies the current directory as the starting point.
  - `-type f`: Searches for files (not directories).
  - `-user testuser`: Filters files owned by `testuser`.

- **`ls -l`**: Lists files in long format, showing detailed information including owner and group.

- **`stat -c '%n %U %G'`**: Displays specified attributes of the file:
  - `%n`: File name
  - `%U`: Owner name
  - `%G`: Group name

### Putting It All Together in a Script

If you want to automate this process, you can create a simple shell script.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to search
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/target/directory"

# User to search for
USER="testuser"

# Change to the target directory
cd "$TARGET_DIR" || exit

# Find files owned by the user and display owner/group information
find . -type f -user "$USER" -exec stat -c '%n %U %G' {} \;
```

### Usage

1. Save the script as `find_testuser_files.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x find_testuser_files.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   ./find_testuser_files.sh
   ```

This script will output the names of the files owned by `testuser` along with their owner and group names, making it easy to identify the relevant files and their ownership details.

To find and delete files that match a specific filename pattern and are older than one week, you can modify the `find` command by adding the `-name` option. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Use the following command, replacing `/path/to/directory` with the path to your directory and `pattern` with your specific filename pattern (e.g., `*.log` for log files, `*.tmp` for temporary files, etc.):

```sh
find /path/to/directory -type f -name "pattern" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
```

For example, to delete all `.log` files older than one week in a directory:

```sh
find /path/to/directory -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
```

Explanation:
- `-name "pattern"`: Specifies the filename pattern to match (e.g., `"*.log"` for all log files).
- The rest of the command remains the same as previously explained.

Again, to test the command without deleting files, you can list the matching files first:

```sh
find /path/to/directory -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7
```

This will list all `.log` files older than one week in the specified directory. Once you are confident the list is correct, you can run the full command to delete the files.



To list the file with the pattern `file-<yyyymmdd>.text` which has the most recent date in a directory and rename it to `file.txt`, you can use the following bash command in Linux:

```bash
# List all files matching the pattern, sort them by the date in the filename, and get the most recent one
recent_file=$(ls file-*.text 2>/dev/null | sort -t '-' -k 2 -nr | head -n 1)

# Check if a file was found
if [ -n "$recent_file" ]; then
  # Rename the most recent file to file.txt
  mv "$recent_file" file.txt
else
  echo "No files matching the pattern were found."
fi
```

Here's a breakdown of what this script does:

1. `ls file-*.text 2>/dev/null`: List all files matching the pattern `file-*.text`. The `2>/dev/null` part suppresses error messages if no files match the pattern.
2. `sort -t '-' -k 2 -nr`: Sort the files by the date part of the filename. The `-t '-'` specifies that the delimiter is a hyphen, `-k 2` sorts based on the second field (which is the date part), and `-nr` sorts numerically in reverse order (newest date first).
3. `head -n 1`: Select the first file from the sorted list, which is the most recent one.
4. `if [ -n "$recent_file" ]; then`: Check if a file was found (i.e., `recent_file` is not empty).
5. `mv "$recent_file" file.txt`: Rename the most recent file to `file.txt`.
6. `echo "No files matching the pattern were found."`: Output a message if no matching files are found.

BAU

To achieve the requirement of getting a list of JIRA issues with their status and summary from a JIRA filter using the REST API via Bamboo, converting the output JSON to HTML, and sending an email with the HTML page, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Bamboo Script Task**:
   - Set up a Bamboo Script task in your Bamboo plan.
   - Use a shell script as the task script.

2. **Shell Script**:
   - Here's a sample shell script that accomplishes the steps:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# JIRA credentials
JIRA_USERNAME="your_username"
JIRA_PASSWORD="your_password"
JIRA_BASE_URL="https://your_company.atlassian.net"
FILTER_ID="12345"  # Replace with your filter ID

# API endpoint to fetch filter results
API_URL="${JIRA_BASE_URL}/rest/api/2/search?jql=filter=${FILTER_ID}"

# Make the API request and save the response to a file
curl -u "${JIRA_USERNAME}:${JIRA_PASSWORD}" -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "${API_URL}" > jira_filter_results.json

# Extract JIRA numbers, status, and summary from JSON
jq -r '.issues[] | [.key, .fields.status.name, .fields.summary] | @csv' jira_filter_results.json > jira_issues.csv

# Convert CSV to HTML table
echo "<table>" > jira_issues.html
cat jira_issues.csv | awk -F ',' '{print "<tr><td>" $1 "</td><td>" $2 "</td><td>" $3 "</td></tr>"}' >> jira_issues.html
echo "</table>" >> jira_issues.html

# Send email with HTML content
echo "JIRA Filter Results" | mail -a "Content-Type: text/html" -s "JIRA Filter Results" your_email@example.com < jira_issues.html
```

3. **Adjustments**:
   - Replace placeholders like `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_company`, `FILTER_ID`, and `your_email@example.com` with your actual details.
   - Customize the script based on your specific JIRA data structure and requirements.

4. **Execution**:
   - Run this script as a Bamboo Script task in your Bamboo plan.
   - Make sure Bamboo has the necessary permissions to access the JIRA API and send emails.

This script fetches JIRA filter results, extracts JIRA numbers, status, and summary, converts the data to an HTML table, and sends an email with the HTML content. Adjust the script as needed for your specific use case.

=#=#=#
You can achieve this using a shell script with awk. Here's an example script that reads a CSV file, adjusts the number of columns in each row to match the number of columns in the header row, and then writes the updated data back to the same file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the number of columns in the header row
numCols=$(head -n 1 input.csv | awk -F, '{print NF}')

# Update the CSV file in place
awk -v numCols="$numCols" -F, '{
    while (NF < numCols) {
        $0 = $0 ", "
    }
    while (NF > numCols) {
        sub(/,[^,]*$/, "")
    }
    print
}' input.csv > temp.csv && mv temp.csv input.csv
```

In this script:
- The `head -n 1 input.csv | awk -F, '{print NF}'` command is used to get the number of columns in the header row.
- The `awk` command is used to iterate through each row in the CSV file.
- If the number of columns in a row is less than the number of columns in the header row, the script appends an empty cell to the row.
- If the number of columns in a row is more than the number of columns in the header row, the script removes the extra columns from the row.
- The updated data is written to a temporary file `temp.csv`, and then the temporary file is renamed to `input.csv` to update the original file in place.

Make sure to replace `input.csv` with the path to your input CSV file in the script. After running this script, the number of columns in each row of the CSV file should match the number of columns in the header row.

You can remove spaces or tabs at the end of each line in a CSV file using a shell script by using the `sed` command. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

input_file="input.csv"
output_file="output.csv"

sed 's/[[:blank:]]*$//' "$input_file" > "$output_file"
```

In this script:
- Replace `input.csv` with the name of your input file.
- The `sed` command is used with the regular expression `[[:blank:]]*$` to remove any spaces or tabs at the end of each line.
- The modified content is then saved to the output file specified by `output.csv`.
- Run the script in your terminal to remove spaces or tabs at the end of each line in the CSV file.

To achieve this in a shell script, you can use tools like `awk` or `sed` to remove empty rows and ensure that each row has the same number of columns as the header. Here's a basic outline of how you can do this:

1. Remove empty rows using `awk`:
```bash
awk 'NF > 0' input.csv > temp.csv
```

2. Count the number of columns in the header row and adjust other rows to match this count:
```bash
num_cols=$(head -n 1 temp.csv | awk -F, '{print NF}')
awk -F, -v num_cols="$num_cols" 'NF != num_cols {for (i=NF+1; i<=num_cols; i++) $i = ""; print}' temp.csv > output.csv
```

3. Replace the original file with the modified file:
```bash
mv output.csv input.csv
```

Make sure to replace `input.csv` with the actual name of your CSV file. This script will remove empty rows and adjust rows with fewer columns than the header to match the header's column count.

=#=#
To make the columns count of rows the same as the header in a CSV file by either removing or appending empty columns, you can use the following script:

```bash
awk -F, 'NR==1 {cols=NF} NF < cols {for(i=NF+1; i<=cols; i++) $i=""} 1' input.csv > output.csv
```

This script checks each row, and if the number of columns in a row is less than the number of columns in the header, it appends empty columns to that row until the column count matches the header. If the row has more columns than the header, those extra columns will be removed. The modified content is then written to output.csv.




=##=#=#
To compare if the lines of two files are matching irrespective of their order, you can use the `sort` command along with `diff`. Here's a shell script that accomplishes this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file1="file1.txt"
file2="file2.txt"

if diff <(sort $file1) <(sort $file2) &> /dev/null; then
    echo "The lines in the files match irrespective of order."
else
    echo "The lines in the files do not match irrespective of order."
fi
```

Save this script in a file, such as `compare_lines.sh`, and make it executable using `chmod +x compare_lines.sh`. Run the script with `./compare_lines.sh` in the terminal to compare the lines of the two files, disregarding their order, and see if they match.

=#=#=#


You can use the `diff` command in a shell script to compare two text files and print the unmatched lines. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file1="file1.txt"
file2="file2.txt"

# Compare the files and output the unmatched lines to a new file
diff --new-line-format="" --unchanged-line-format="" $file1 $file2 > unmatched_lines.txt

# Display the unmatched lines
cat unmatched_lines.txt
```

Save this script in a file, for example, `compare_files.sh`, and make it executable using the command `chmod +x compare_files.sh`. Then you can run the script using `./compare_files.sh` in the terminal to compare the two text files and print the unmatched lines.

#==#


You can use the `comm` command in a shell script to compare two text files and print the matched lines. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file1="file1.txt"
file2="file2.txt"

# Compare the files and output the matched lines
comm -12 <(sort $file1) <(sort $file2)
```

Save this script in a file, for example, `compare_matched_lines.sh`, and make it executable using the command `chmod +x compare_matched_lines.sh`. Then you can run the script using `./compare_matched_lines.sh` in the terminal to compare the two text files and print the matched lines.

To loop over a list of lines in a text file using a shell script, you can use a `while` loop in combination with the `read` command. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming your text file is named "list.txt"
file="list.txt"

# Check if the file exists
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Process each line here
        echo "Processing line: $line"
    done < "$file"
else
    echo "File not found: $file"
fi
```

In this script:
- `while` loop reads each line from the file specified by `file`.
- `read -r line` reads each line from the file and stores it in the variable `line`.
- `IFS=` prevents leading/trailing whitespace from being trimmed.
- `echo "Processing line: $line"` is where you can perform operations on each line. Replace this with your actual processing logic.

Remember to replace `"list.txt"` with the actual path to your text file. This script will read each line from the file and process it as needed.

To check if an HTTP response shows that a session is not valid and renew the session using a shell script, you can use tools like cURL and jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor). Here's a general outline of how you can achieve this:

1. Make an HTTP request to check the session validity using cURL and save the response to a file:

```bash
curl -s -o response.json -X GET http://your-api-endpoint
```

2. Check if the session is invalid in the response JSON using jq:

```bash
invalid_session=$(jq -r '.error' response.json)
```

3. If the session is invalid, renew the session by making a new HTTP request to obtain a new session token:

```bash
if [[ "$invalid_session" == "Session not valid" ]]; then
    # Add logic to renew the session, e.g., by making another request to obtain a new session token
    curl -s -o new_token.json -X POST http://your-auth-endpoint
fi
```

4. You can then proceed with your original request using the new session token.

Remember to replace `http://your-api-endpoint` with your actual API endpoint and `http://your-auth-endpoint` with your actual authentication endpoint. This is a basic outline, and you may need to adapt it to suit your specific requirements and API endpoints.
