# Set your AWS access key and secret access key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"

# Set the name of your S3 bucket
BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"

# Set the path where you want to download the file

To get a list of files from an S3 bucket based on a specific pattern and filter them by the recent date using Boto3, you can follow this example:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError
from datetime import datetime

# Replace 'bucket-name' with the actual name of your S3 bucket
bucket_name = 'bucket-name'
# Replace 'file-pattern' with the pattern you want to match for file names
file_pattern = 'file-pattern'

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

try:
    # List all objects in the bucket
    response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)

    # Filter the objects based on the file pattern
    objects = [obj['Key'] for obj in response['Contents'] if file_pattern in obj['Key']]

    # Sort the objects based on the most recent modified date
    objects.sort(key=lambda x: s3.head_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=x)['LastModified'], reverse=True)

    # Get the most recent file
    most_recent_file = objects[0]
    print(f"The most recent file matching the pattern {file_pattern} is: {most_recent_file}")
except NoCredentialsError:
    print('No AWS credentials found. Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials.')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

Make sure to replace `'bucket-name'` with the actual name of your S3 bucket and `'file-pattern'` with the pattern you want to match for the file names.

python
import boto3
import os
import fnmatch

# Set up the AWS credentials and region
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)

# Create an S3 client
s3 = session.client('s3')

# Specify the S3 bucket name
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'

# Specify the filename pattern
filename_pattern = '*.txt'  # Example: Download all files with a .txt extension

# List objects in the bucket
response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Download files matching the filename pattern
for obj in response['Contents']:
    key = obj['Key']
    if fnmatch.fnmatch(key, filename_pattern):
        # Extract the filename from the key
        filename = os.path.basename(key)
        
        # Download the file
        s3.download_file(bucket_name, key, filename)
        print(f"Downloaded file: {filename}")



Benefits of CICD for NEOXAM application?

Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for the Neoxam application can bring several benefits, including:

1. **Faster and more frequent releases**: CI/CD enables automated and streamlined software delivery, allowing for faster and more frequent releases of the Neoxam application. This means that new features, bug fixes, and improvements can reach users more quickly, resulting in enhanced user satisfaction and a competitive advantage.

2. **Improved code quality**: CI/CD incorporates automated testing and code quality checks into the development process. This helps identify issues early on, such as coding errors, unit test failures, or security vulnerabilities. By catching and addressing these issues earlier, the overall code quality of the Neoxam application can be improved.

3. **Reduced manual effort and errors**: CI/CD automates various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying the application. This reduces the reliance on manual processes, which are prone to errors and inconsistencies. Automation ensures that the Neoxam application is built and deployed consistently, minimizing the risk of human error.

4. **Increased collaboration and visibility**: CI/CD promotes collaboration among development teams by providing a centralized and shared environment. It allows developers to work on different features simultaneously, merge code changes, and resolve conflicts efficiently. Additionally, the CI/CD pipeline provides visibility into the application's build, test, and deployment stages, enabling teams to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks.

5. **Easier rollback and faster issue resolution**: With CI/CD, it becomes easier to rollback to a previous version of the Neoxam application if any issues arise in production. By having a well-defined deployment pipeline and version control system, developers can quickly identify the problematic release and revert to a stable version. This minimizes downtime and accelerates issue resolution.

6. **Scalability and reliability**: CI/CD pipelines can be designed to scale with the application's growth. As the Neoxam application evolves, the CI/CD process can handle increased development, testing, and deployment demands. This scalability ensures that the application remains reliable and can accommodate changes in user requirements and market conditions.

Overall, implementing CI/CD for the Neoxam application can streamline software delivery, improve code quality, enhance collaboration, and provide a more efficient and reliable development process.

To set up LDAP for a Swing application, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Choose an LDAP server**: Decide on an LDAP server to use, such as OpenLDAP or Microsoft Active Directory. Install and configure the server according to your requirements.

2. **Add LDAP libraries**: Include the necessary LDAP libraries in your Swing application's classpath. These libraries provide the APIs required to communicate with the LDAP server. For example, you can use the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API provided by Java.

3. **Establish a connection**: In your Swing application, establish a connection to the LDAP server using the appropriate connection details, such as server address, port, and credentials. This typically involves creating an instance of the LDAP context.

4. **Perform LDAP operations**: Once connected, you can perform various LDAP operations, such as searching for entries, adding or modifying entries, and deleting entries. These operations involve constructing LDAP queries and using the LDAP API to execute them against the server.

5. **Handle responses**: Process the responses received from the LDAP server, such as search results or success/failure indications for add/modify/delete operations. You can extract the required information from the LDAP responses and update your Swing application accordingly.

6. **Close the connection**: When you're done using the LDAP server, make sure to close the connection to release any resources. This typically involves calling the appropriate method to close the LDAP context.

It's important to note that implementing LDAP functionality in a Swing application can be complex, and it's recommended to refer to the documentation and examples provided by your LDAP server and LDAP library to understand the specific details and APIs involved.

Certainly! Here's a shell script that can help you compute the previous business date:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if a given date is a weekend (Saturday or Sunday)
is_weekend() {
    local day_of_week=$(date -d "$1" +%u)
    if [[ $day_of_week == 6 || $day_of_week == 7 ]]; then
        return 0
    else
        return 1
    fi
}

# Function to compute the previous business date
previous_business_date() {
    local date_str=$1
    while is_weekend "$date_str"; do
        date_str=$(date -d "$date_str -1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)
    done
    echo "$date_str"
}

# Usage example
current_date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
previous_biz_date=$(previous_business_date "$current_date")
echo "Previous business date: $previous_biz_date"
```

Save the above script to a file, let's say `previous_biz_date.sh`. Make it executable by running `chmod +x previous_biz_date.sh`. Then, you can run it by executing `./previous_biz_date.sh`.

The script uses the `date` command to check if a given date is a weekend, and if so, it subtracts one day until it finds a non-weekend date. Finally, it prints the previous business date.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.


python
import boto3

def list_subfolders(bucket_name, prefix):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name, Prefix=prefix, Delimiter='/')
    
    subfolders = []
    if 'CommonPrefixes' in response:
        subfolders = [obj['Prefix'] for obj in response['CommonPrefixes']]
    
    return subfolders

# Example usage
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
prefix = 'your-folder-prefix/'

subfolders = list_subfolders(bucket_name, prefix)
print(subfolders)










This script first lists all objects in the S3 bucket using the `list_objects_v2` API. It then filters the objects based on the specified file pattern. The filtered objects are sorted based on the most recent modified date using the `LastModified` property obtained from the `head_object` API call. Finally, the script prints the most recent file that matches the file pattern.
