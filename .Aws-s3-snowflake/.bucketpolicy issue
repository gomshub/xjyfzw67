Ah — now I see exactly where the confusion is. Let’s make this crystal clear in one go.

⸻

1️⃣ Why IAM user can do S3 actions but Lambda cannot

Your setup:
	•	Bucket policy has:

"Deny": {
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Condition": {
      "Bool": {"aws:SecureTransport": "false"},
      "StringNotEquals": {"aws:SourceVpce": "vpce-xxxx"}
  }
}

	•	IAM user is connecting via the VPCE → matches the condition → Deny does NOT apply → IAM user’s Allow permissions work → can Get/Put objects.
	•	Lambda is in the same VPC → should also go through VPCE, but control-plane calls like DeleteBucketPolicy do NOT go through the VPCE.

Key point:
	•	IAM user uses the VPCE for data-plane operations (GetObject, PutObject) → works
	•	Lambda attempts DeleteBucketPolicy (control-plane) → VPCE not used → aws:SourceVpce missing → Deny triggers → blocked
	•	IAM Allow cannot override Deny → Lambda fails

✅ So IAM user works because the request matches the VPCE condition. Lambda fails because control-plane requests ignore the VPCE.

⸻

2️⃣ Can IAM user delete the bucket policy if allowed?

Yes — IAM Allow can delete the bucket policy only if the bucket policy does not have a Deny that blocks this user.
	•	If bucket policy has no Deny on s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, then:

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID>:user/<IAM-USER>" }
}

→ The IAM user can delete the bucket policy.
	•	If bucket policy has a Deny (like the SourceVpce or SecureTransport deny), then even IAM user cannot delete unless the request satisfies the Deny condition.

⸻

3️⃣ Bottom line

Principal	Action	Why it works or fails
IAM user	Get/Put	Works because IAM user request satisfies the bucket policy Deny conditions (via VPCE or public endpoint).
IAM user	DeleteBucketPolicy	Works only if bucket policy does not Deny it. If Deny exists, IAM Allow cannot override.
Lambda	DeleteBucketPolicy	Fails if bucket policy Deny exists (VPCE condition or other) because Lambda control-plane calls do not go through VPCE → Deny triggers.
Lambda IAM policy	Add Allow	Alone cannot fix Deny → must also add explicit Allow in bucket policy for Lambda role.


⸻

✅ Solution for Lambda
	1.	Add explicit Allow in the bucket policy for the Lambda role for:

s3:DeleteBucketPolicy
s3:PutBucketPolicy
s3:GetBucketPolicy

	2.	Keep existing Deny statements for all other principals.

⸻

If you want, I can draw a simple diagram showing IAM user vs Lambda vs S3 bucket policy evaluation — it usually makes this crystal clear in 30 seconds.

Do you want me to do that?
==

Here is the best, final, correct answer in one place — no ambiguity, no options, no back-and-forth.

⸻

✅ THE REAL REASON IAM USER WORKS BUT LAMBDA FAILS

✔ IAM user works

Because IAM user traffic does NOT go through the S3 VPC endpoint →
It directly hits public S3 over HTTPS, so the bucket policy condition:

"Deny": {
  "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:SecureTransport": "false" } }
}

and

"Condition": { "StringEquals": { "aws:SourceVpce": "vpce-xxxx" } }

does NOT block the IAM user.

IAM user = public S3 = bucket policy doesn’t evaluate VPCE conditions → allowed.

⸻

❌ WHY LAMBDA FAILS EVEN WHEN IN SAME VPC

Lambda is in your VPC, but the key mistake is:

❗ S3 Control-plane actions do NOT use the VPC endpoint

The following actions:
	•	DeleteBucketPolicy
	•	PutBucketPolicy
	•	GetBucketPolicy

are control-plane actions.

S3 control-plane requests ALWAYS go out to public AWS endpoints, NOT through your VPCE.

Therefore the bucket policy sees:
	•	No aws:SourceVpce
	•	No aws:SourceVpc

And your bucket policy has:

"Effect": "Deny",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:*",
"Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": { "aws:SourceVpce": "vpce-xxxx" }
}

Because the aws:SourceVpce key is missing, AWS interprets it as NOT matching → explicit Deny applies.

Explicit Deny beats Lambda role always.

⸻

🎯 THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT (THE BEST SOLUTION)

Since control-plane does not go through VPCE, and explicit Deny blocks Lambda, the ONLY correct fix is:

✅ Add an Allow for the Lambda Role that overrides the Deny condition

Update your bucket policy with this exact block:

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-ID>:role/lambda-s3-full-access-role" },
  "Action": [
      "s3:DeleteBucketPolicy",
      "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
      "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
}

✔ This works because:
	•	An Allow without conditions takes precedence before evaluating the Deny condition.
	•	This gives Lambda permission even if request does not come from VPCE.

⸻

🚫 NOT NEEDED & NOT EFFECTIVE
	•	You do NOT need to add SourceVpce to Lambda IAM policy
	•	You do NOT need to modify the VPC endpoint
	•	You do NOT need to use SourceVpc
	•	You do NOT need to redeploy Lambda into another subnet

None of those fix the root cause.

⸻

🟢 FINAL SUMMARY (1-Minute Version)

IAM user works → uses public S3 → bucket policy VPCE conditions not evaluated.

Lambda fails → control-plane does not use VPCE → bucket policy sees missing aws:SourceVpce → explicit Deny triggers → Lambda blocked.

Fix → Add explicit “Allow” for the Lambda role to bypass SourceVpce Deny match.
