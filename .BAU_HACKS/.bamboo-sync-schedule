Yes, you can use Bamboo to schedule and trigger the Python module sync service. Bamboo allows you to create plans and schedule tasks, which can include running shell scripts.

Here's how you can achieve this:

### Steps:

1. **Create a Bamboo Plan**: Define a new plan in Bamboo.
2. **Add a Script Task**: Add a task to the plan to run a shell script that will execute the Python sync service.
3. **Schedule the Plan**: Set a schedule for the plan to run at your desired intervals.

### Shell Script to Trigger Sync Service

Create a shell script, `sync_service.sh`, to run the Python sync service.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Activate virtual environment if needed
# source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate

# Navigate to the directory containing your sync_service.py
cd /path/to/your/module

# Run the sync service
python sync_service.py
```

### Bamboo Plan Configuration

1. **Create a New Plan**:
   - Go to your Bamboo dashboard.
   - Click on "Create" > "Create Plan".
   - Fill in the necessary details for your plan, such as project, plan name, etc.

2. **Add a Script Task**:
   - In the "Plan Configuration", navigate to "Jobs" under "Stages & Jobs".
   - Click on "Default Job" or create a new job if needed.
   - Under the job configuration, click on "Tasks".
   - Click "Add Task" > "Script".
   - Fill in the details for the script task:
     - **Description**: Sync Service
     - **Script Location**: Inline or File (choose File if you have the script in your repository)
     - **Script Body** (if Inline):
       ```sh
       #!/bin/bash
       cd /path/to/your/module
       python sync_service.py
       ```

3. **Schedule the Plan**:
   - Go to the "Triggers" tab in the plan configuration.
   - Click "Add Trigger" > "Scheduled".
   - Set the schedule for when you want the plan to run (e.g., every 10 minutes, daily, etc.).
   - Configure the cron expression or use the provided options to set the interval.

### Example of Bamboo Plan Trigger Configuration

For example, to run the plan every 10 minutes, use a cron expression like this:

```plaintext
0 */10 * ? * *
```

### Summary

- **Shell Script**: Write a simple shell script (`sync_service.sh`) to navigate to your module directory and run the `sync_service.py`.
- **Bamboo Plan**: Create a new Bamboo plan, add a script task to run the shell script, and set a schedule for the plan to run periodically.

This setup will ensure that your Python sync service is triggered at the specified intervals, updating the database as needed. Adjust the paths and scheduling details according to your specific environment and requirements.
