To achieve this use case, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Python Module Structure**:
   - Create a Python module that interacts with the JIRA REST API to fetch issue details and updates the database based on the summary title.
   - The module should have functions to:
     - Authenticate with JIRA API.
     - Get issues from a JIRA filter based on the filter ID.
     - Extract details like status, assignee, summary, comments from the retrieved issues.
     - Update the database based on the summary title.
   - Implement error handling and logging within the module.

2. **Kubernetes Service**:
   - Containerize the Python module using Docker.
   - Create a Kubernetes deployment and service manifest to deploy the containerized module as a service.
   - Expose necessary ports for communication with the module.

3. **Shell Script**:
   - Create a shell script that utilizes `kubectl` commands to interact with the Kubernetes service.
   - Use `curl` or `wget` commands within the script to trigger the Python module's endpoints exposed by the Kubernetes service.
   - Handle responses from the Python module appropriately within the shell script.

4. **Code Example**:
   - Here is a simplified example of the Python module structure:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import requests
import json
import pymysql

# Function to get JIRA issues from a filter
def get_jira_filter_issues(filter_id):
    # Implement JIRA API authentication and request to fetch issues
    # Return JSON response containing issues

# Function to update database based on issue summary
def update_db_based_on_summary(issue_summary, environment):
    # Connect to the database based on the environment
    # Execute SQL queries to update the database
    
# Main function to fetch JIRA issues and update the database
def process_jira_issues_and_update_db():
    filter_id = 'your_filter_id'
    issues = get_jira_filter_issues(filter_id)
    
    for issue in issues:
        issue_summary = issue['fields']['summary']
        environment = 'Prod' if 'Prod' in issue_summary else 'Quality' if 'Quality' in issue_summary else 'Dev'
        update_db_based_on_summary(issue_summary, environment)

# Call the main function to start the process
if __name__ == '__main__':
    process_jira_issues_and_update_db()
```

Please note that this is a basic example, and you need to add error handling, logging, and proper database connection details based on your setup. Also, the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations will depend on your specific infrastructure.
