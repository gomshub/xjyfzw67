Incremental Cloning in Oracle Database

Yes, incremental cloning is possible in Oracle, and it has been enhanced over the years. Oracle provides RMAN (Recovery Manager) features for incremental backups and cloning. With RMAN, you can perform an incremental refresh of a database clone or a standby database.

Key Features for Incremental Cloning in Oracle:
	1.	Active Database Duplication: Clone a database directly from a live database over the network without pre-existing backups.
	2.	Incremental Backups: Apply only the changed blocks since the last backup.
	3.	Duplicate Database with Incremental Backup:
	•	Create an initial clone using RMAN DUPLICATE or other cloning methods.
	•	Periodically refresh the clone with changes using incremental backups.

Documentation Availability:

There is extensive official documentation and community knowledge for Oracle RMAN and incremental cloning:
	1.	Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User’s Guide
	2.	Tutorials and blogs on Oracle’s website and other platforms.
	3.	Oracle Support notes on My Oracle Support (MOS), available to customers.

Use Case Example:
	•	Data Masking: Use Oracle Data Masking and Subsetting to create a masked, refreshed clone.
	•	Test and Dev: Refresh a test database from production incrementally to save time and storage.

AWS Database Cloning with Incremental Refresh

AWS supports database cloning via services like Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora. Both provide features for creating and managing clones, including incremental updates.

Aurora Cloning:
	•	Aurora supports fast database cloning, which creates a new database instance by sharing storage at the block level.
	•	Incremental Changes: When a clone writes to the database, only the changed blocks are copied, making it highly efficient.
	•	Storage remains shared until data changes occur, after which blocks are split.

AWS RDS Snapshots:
	•	RDS allows for manual or automated snapshots of databases.
	•	Incremental Snapshots: Subsequent snapshots are incremental; only changes since the last snapshot are stored.
	•	Restoring from snapshots creates a new database instance, but there isn’t direct support for incremental cloning (e.g., continuous refresh of the clone).

Documentation Availability:

AWS has detailed documentation and whitepapers on these features:
	1.	Aurora Cloning
	2.	RDS Backup and Restore
	3.	Best practices for Aurora and RDS available on the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Comparison: Oracle vs AWS Incremental Clone

Feature	Oracle RMAN	AWS Aurora/RDS
Incremental Refresh	Supported using RMAN or Data Guard.	Aurora supports shared storage; RDS uses snapshots.
Efficiency	Requires applying backup changes.	Aurora is block-level and highly efficient.
Documentation	Extensive official docs and MOS.	Extensive AWS documentation and whitepapers.
Use Case	Ideal for masking, test/dev, DR setups.	Test/dev, scaling read replicas.
