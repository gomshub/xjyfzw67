You can use the following kubectl command to get cluster information in YAML format:

1️⃣ Get Full Cluster Info in YAML

kubectl cluster-info dump > cluster-info.yaml

	•	This dumps detailed cluster information into a YAML file (cluster-info.yaml).
	•	It includes kube-system components, configurations, and status.

2️⃣ Get Node Allocatable Resources in YAML

If you want allocatable CPU/Memory for nodes:

kubectl get nodes -o yaml > nodes-info.yaml

	•	This will give details about CPU, memory, and capacity per node.

3️⃣ Get Only Node Resource Summary

If you only need a quick look at node resources, run:

kubectl describe nodes > nodes-summary.txt

	•	This shows allocatable resources, capacity, and pod limits for each node.
