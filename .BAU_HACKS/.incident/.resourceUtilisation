To get a rough estimate of CPU and memory usage for the fetch_and_compare.sh script and the interactive service, you can use time, top, and ps commands.

üìú Shell Script: monitor_usage.sh

This script will:
	1.	Run the fetch script and measure CPU & memory usage.
	2.	Log the resource consumption in a file.
	3.	Can be scheduled with cron to monitor periodically.

#!/bin/bash

# Path to the fetch_and_compare.sh script
SCRIPT_PATH="/path/to/fetch_and_compare.sh"

# Log file
LOG_FILE="/var/log/script_usage.log"

echo "Running fetch_and_compare.sh with resource monitoring..."

# Run script and measure time
/usr/bin/time -v bash "$SCRIPT_PATH" > /dev/null 2>> "$LOG_FILE" &

# Get PID of the running process
SCRIPT_PID=$!

# Monitor CPU and memory usage every second while the script runs
while ps -p $SCRIPT_PID > /dev/null; do
    ps -p $SCRIPT_PID -o %cpu,%mem,vsz,rss --no-headers >> "$LOG_FILE"
    sleep 1
done

echo "Resource usage logged in $LOG_FILE"

‚è≤Ô∏è Schedule it with Cron (Every 30 min)

Add to crontab:

*/30 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/monitor_usage.sh

üîç Understanding Metrics in script_usage.log
	‚Ä¢	%CPU ‚Üí CPU usage percentage.
	‚Ä¢	%MEM ‚Üí Memory usage percentage.
	‚Ä¢	VSZ (Virtual Size) ‚Üí Total memory the process is using (including swapped-out memory).
	‚Ä¢	RSS (Resident Set Size) ‚Üí Actual RAM being used (excluding swapped memory).

üìä Estimate Resources in Kubernetes

After running the script for a few hours/days, check the logs:

tail -n 50 /var/log/script_usage.log

Example output:

2.5  1.2  200000  50000
3.0  1.5  250000  60000

	‚Ä¢	If CPU usage averages 2-3%, request 250m (0.25 CPU) in Kubernetes.
	‚Ä¢	If Memory (RSS) is ~60MB, request 128Mi for safety.

üìù Adjusting Kubernetes Resource Requests

In Helm values.yaml or Kubernetes deployment.yaml:

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"

This method provides real-world usage metrics for better Kubernetes resource allocation. üöÄ

Let‚Äôs analyze if your single-node Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to deploy a new pod with 500m CPU and 2048Mi Memory.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Available Resources

Your node allocatable resources:
	‚Ä¢	CPU = 8 cores
	‚Ä¢	Memory = 32,734,608 Ki ‚âà 31.2 GiB

Currently allocated resources (for 2 running pods):
	‚Ä¢	CPU Requests: 500m + 500m = 1 core
	‚Ä¢	Memory Requests: 4096Mi + 2048Mi = 6144Mi (6 GiB)

2Ô∏è‚É£ After Deploying the New Pod

Your new pod requests:
	‚Ä¢	CPU = 500m (0.5 core)
	‚Ä¢	Memory = 2048Mi (2 GiB)

Total resource consumption after deployment:
	‚Ä¢	CPU Requests: 1 core + 0.5 core = 1.5 cores ‚úÖ (still far from 8 cores available)
	‚Ä¢	Memory Requests: 6 GiB + 2 GiB = 8 GiB ‚úÖ (still far from 31.2 GiB available)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Will It Fit? ‚úÖ Yes, the node has enough resources.
	‚Ä¢	CPU Utilization: 1.5 cores out of 8 ‚Üí Only 18.75% used.
	‚Ä¢	Memory Utilization: 8 GiB out of 31.2 GiB ‚Üí Only 25.6% used.

Your node has sufficient CPU and memory to handle this new deployment without overloading.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Considerations for Future Deployments

‚úÖ You can deploy this pod without issues.
‚ùó If you deploy more services, monitor CPU and Memory usage in Grafana to ensure the node isn‚Äôt overloaded.
‚ùó If your node runs close to 80% CPU or Memory, consider adding more nodes or optimizing resources.
