Let’s analyze if your single-node Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to deploy a new pod with 500m CPU and 2048Mi Memory.

1️⃣ Check Available Resources

Your node allocatable resources:
	•	CPU = 8 cores
	•	Memory = 32,734,608 Ki ≈ 31.2 GiB

Currently allocated resources (for 2 running pods):
	•	CPU Requests: 500m + 500m = 1 core
	•	Memory Requests: 4096Mi + 2048Mi = 6144Mi (6 GiB)

2️⃣ After Deploying the New Pod

Your new pod requests:
	•	CPU = 500m (0.5 core)
	•	Memory = 2048Mi (2 GiB)

Total resource consumption after deployment:
	•	CPU Requests: 1 core + 0.5 core = 1.5 cores ✅ (still far from 8 cores available)
	•	Memory Requests: 6 GiB + 2 GiB = 8 GiB ✅ (still far from 31.2 GiB available)

3️⃣ Will It Fit? ✅ Yes, the node has enough resources.
	•	CPU Utilization: 1.5 cores out of 8 → Only 18.75% used.
	•	Memory Utilization: 8 GiB out of 31.2 GiB → Only 25.6% used.

Your node has sufficient CPU and memory to handle this new deployment without overloading.

4️⃣ Considerations for Future Deployments

✅ You can deploy this pod without issues.
❗ If you deploy more services, monitor CPU and Memory usage in Grafana to ensure the node isn’t overloaded.
❗ If your node runs close to 80% CPU or Memory, consider adding more nodes or optimizing resources.
