To determine the CPU and RAM required for a Python module running on Windows in a development environment, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Measure CPU & Memory Usage with psutil

You can use the psutil Python module to track resource usage while the module runs.

📜 Script to Monitor Resource Usage

import psutil
import time
import os

# Get the PID of the current process
pid = os.getpid()
process = psutil.Process(pid)

print(f"Monitoring process {pid}...")

while True:
    # Get CPU and memory usage
    cpu_usage = process.cpu_percent(interval=1)  # 1-second interval
    memory_info = process.memory_info()
    memory_usage = memory_info.rss / (1024 * 1024)  # Convert bytes to MB

    print(f"CPU: {cpu_usage}% | Memory: {memory_usage:.2f} MB")

    time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds

🔹 How This Works:
	•	psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1): Monitors CPU usage.
	•	process.memory_info().rss: Gets resident memory (RAM usage).
	•	Prints CPU & memory usage every 5 seconds.

📌 Run your Python module while monitoring usage.

2️⃣ Use Windows Task Manager
	1.	Run your Python script:

python your_script.py


	2.	Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
	3.	Go to “Processes” → Find python.exe.
	4.	Monitor:
	•	CPU usage (percentage).
	•	Memory (RAM) usage (MB).
	•	Peak usage over time.

📌 Take the highest values recorded to determine peak needs.

3️⃣ Use Windows Resource Monitor
	1.	Press Win + R, type resmon, and press Enter.
	2.	Go to the CPU & Memory tabs.
	3.	Look for python.exe and check:
	•	CPU usage (percentage)
	•	RAM usage (Working Set/Private Bytes)

📌 Best for real-time monitoring during long runs.

4️⃣ Profiling with cProfile (Advanced)

For deeper insights into function-level CPU usage:

python -m cProfile -s time your_script.py

📌 This helps find CPU-intensive functions.

📊 How to Estimate Resources for Kubernetes?
	•	Take the peak CPU & memory usage.
	•	Add a buffer (20–30%) for safe limits.
	•	Define resource requests & limits in Kubernetes YAML.

Example:

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"   # 50% of a core
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "1"      # 1 core max
    memory: "512Mi"
