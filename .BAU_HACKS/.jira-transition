To transition a JIRA issue status to "Resolved" using the JIRA REST API and `curl`, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Find the Transition ID for "Resolved" Status:**
   - Use the JIRA API to get a list of available transitions for a specific issue.

2. **Perform the Transition:**
   - Use the JIRA API to transition the issue to the "Resolved" status using the transition ID obtained in step 1.

Here is a step-by-step guide along with the necessary `curl` commands:

### Step 1: Get the Transition ID for "Resolved" Status

First, find the transition ID for the "Resolved" status. Replace `YOUR_ISSUE_KEY` with the key of the JIRA issue you want to transition.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
JIRA_URL="https://your-jira-instance"
USERNAME="your-jira-username"
PASSWORD="your-jira-password"
ISSUE_KEY="YOUR_ISSUE_KEY"

# Get transitions
TRANSITIONS_JSON=$(curl -s -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/issue/$ISSUE_KEY/transitions")

# Extract the transition ID for "Resolved"
TRANSITION_ID=$(echo $TRANSITIONS_JSON | jq -r '.transitions[] | select(.name == "Resolved") | .id')

if [ -z "$TRANSITION_ID" ]; then
  echo "Error: Unable to find transition ID for 'Resolved'."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Transition ID for 'Resolved': $TRANSITION_ID"
```

### Step 2: Transition the Issue to "Resolved"

Once you have the transition ID, use it to transition the issue to the "Resolved" status.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
JIRA_URL="https://your-jira-instance"
USERNAME="your-jira-username"
PASSWORD="your-jira-password"
ISSUE_KEY="YOUR_ISSUE_KEY"

# Get transitions
TRANSITIONS_JSON=$(curl -s -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/issue/$ISSUE_KEY/transitions")

# Extract the transition ID for "Resolved"
TRANSITION_ID=$(echo $TRANSITIONS_JSON | jq -r '.transitions[] | select(.name == "Resolved") | .id')

if [ -z "$TRANSITION_ID" ]; then
  echo "Error: Unable to find transition ID for 'Resolved'."
  exit 1
fi

# Transition the issue to "Resolved"
TRANSITION_PAYLOAD=$(cat <<EOF
{
  "transition": {
    "id": "$TRANSITION_ID"
  }
}
EOF
)

TRANSITION_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$TRANSITION_PAYLOAD" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/issue/$ISSUE_KEY/transitions")

# Check for errors
if [ -z "$TRANSITION_RESPONSE" ]; then
  echo "Successfully transitioned issue $ISSUE_KEY to 'Resolved'."
else
  echo "Error transitioning issue: $TRANSITION_RESPONSE"
fi
```

### Explanation:

1. **Get Transition ID:**
   - Fetch available transitions for the issue using `curl`.
   - Use `jq` to parse the JSON response and extract the ID for the "Resolved" transition.

2. **Transition the Issue:**
   - Construct the payload with the extracted transition ID.
   - Use `curl` to POST the transition request to the JIRA API.

### Notes:
- Replace `your-jira-instance` with your actual JIRA instance URL.
- Replace `YOUR_ISSUE_KEY` with the actual JIRA issue key you want to transition.
- Ensure `jq` is installed on your system (`sudo apt-get install jq`).

This script will transition a JIRA issue to the "Resolved" status by finding the appropriate transition ID and then performing the transition using the JIRA REST API.
