Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool created by HashiCorp, used to build, manage, and version control infrastructure resources declaratively. Here's an example usage scenario and a step-by-step guide on how to use Terraform:

### Example Usage Scenario: Provisioning AWS EC2 Instance

Suppose you want to provision an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### Step 1: Install Terraform

1. Download the Terraform binary suitable for your operating system from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Extract the downloaded binary to a directory included in your system's PATH.

#### Step 2: Set Up AWS Credentials

1. Obtain AWS access key ID and secret access key from the AWS Management Console.

2. Set up AWS credentials by either:
   - Using AWS CLI: Run `aws configure` and provide the access key ID and secret access key.
   - Exporting environment variables:
     ```bash
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_id"
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key"
     ```

#### Step 3: Create Terraform Configuration File

1. Create a new directory for your Terraform project and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir terraform-example
   cd terraform-example
   ```

2. Create a new Terraform configuration file named `main.tf`:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

   - Replace `"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"` with the AMI ID of your choice.

#### Step 4: Initialize Terraform

1. Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download necessary providers:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

#### Step 5: Preview Changes

1. Run the following command to preview the changes that Terraform will make:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

#### Step 6: Apply Changes

1. Apply the changes to provision the EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

#### Step 7: Verify Provisioned Resources

1. After the `apply` command completes, Terraform will output information about the provisioned resources.
2. Verify in the AWS Management Console that the EC2 instance has been provisioned.

#### Step 8: Destroy Resources (Optional)

1. If you want to tear down the provisioned resources, run:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

### Conclusion

By following this example, you've learned how to provision an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as code, enabling version control, automation, and reproducibility of your infrastructure deployments. Experiment with different Terraform configurations and explore its capabilities to manage various infrastructure resources on different cloud providers.
