To configure HTTPS routing in Apache Load Balancer for a Tomcat web service URL, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Install and configure Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy and mod_proxy_balancer modules. These modules enable reverse proxy and load balancing functionality.

2. Configure SSL/TLS certificate on Apache HTTP Server to enable HTTPS. You can obtain and install an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) or use a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.

3. Configure the virtual host in Apache HTTP Server to handle HTTPS requests and proxy them to the Tomcat backend servers. Here's an example configuration:

   ```
   <VirtualHost *:443>
     ServerName example.com
     SSLEngine on
     SSLCertificateFile /path/to/ssl_certificate.crt
     SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/ssl_private_key.key

     ProxyPass / http://tomcat-server1:8080/ route=worker1
     ProxyPassReverse / http://tomcat-server1:8080/

     ProxyPass / http://tomcat-server2:8080/ route=worker2
     ProxyPassReverse / http://tomcat-server2:8080/

     <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
       BalancerMember http://tomcat-server1:8080 route=worker1
       BalancerMember http://tomcat-server2:8080 route=worker2
       ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
     </Proxy>

     ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
     ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   In this example, replace `example.com` with your domain name, `/path/to/ssl_certificate.crt` and `/path/to/ssl_private_key.key` with the paths to your SSL certificate and private key files, and `tomcat-server1:8080` and `tomcat-server2:8080` with the actual addresses of your Tomcat backend servers.

   The `ProxyPass` directives specify the routing for the web service URLs to the corresponding Tomcat servers. The `<Proxy>` and `BalancerMember` directives define the load balancing configuration.

4. Restart the Apache HTTP Server to apply the configuration changes.

With this configuration, Apache HTTP Server acts as a reverse proxy that handles HTTPS requests and forwards them to the Tomcat backend servers using the configured load balancing algorithm.

Note: Ensure that the necessary firewall rules and network configurations are in place to allow traffic between the Apache HTTP Server and the Tomcat backend servers.

Remember to adjust the configuration according to your specific environment and requirements.




================##

If you want to perform HTTPS rerouting via Tomcat itself, you can achieve it by configuring Tomcat to handle HTTPS requests and redirect them to the appropriate web service URL. Here's an example of how you can do it:

1. Ensure that Tomcat is set up to handle HTTPS requests. This involves configuring SSL/TLS certificates on Tomcat. You can follow the Tomcat documentation or refer to your specific server setup for instructions on configuring SSL/TLS.

2. Once you have SSL/TLS configured on Tomcat, you can set up the rerouting by modifying the `web.xml` file of your web application. Locate the `<security-constraint>` section and add the following code:

   ```xml
   <security-constraint>
     <web-resource-collection>
       <web-resource-name>HTTPS Redirect</web-resource-name>
       <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
     </web-resource-collection>
     <user-data-constraint>
       <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
     </user-data-constraint>
   </security-constraint>
   ```

   This configuration enforces secure (HTTPS) access to all URLs in your web application.

3. Next, locate the `<login-config>` section in `web.xml` and add the following code:

   ```xml
   <login-config>
     <auth-method>CLIENT-CERT</auth-method>
   </login-config>
   ```

   This configuration instructs Tomcat to use client certificates for authentication. Adjust the authentication method as per your requirements.

4. Save the changes to `web.xml` and restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.

With this configuration, when a user accesses your web application using an HTTP URL, Tomcat will automatically redirect them to the corresponding HTTPS URL. The rerouting happens within Tomcat itself.

Note: Make sure that the appropriate firewall rules and network configurations are in place to allow HTTPS traffic to reach Tomcat.

Remember to adapt the configuration based on your specific environment and requirements.

Apologies for the confusion. If you want to reroute an incoming HTTPS request to a different HTTPS URL within Tomcat for a web service, you can achieve it by using the `RemoteIpValve` and `RewriteValve` in Tomcat. Here's an example of how you can do it:

1. Open the `server.xml` file of your Tomcat server configuration.

2. Locate the `<Engine>` element and add the following `Valve` configuration inside it:

   ```xml
   <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve"
          protocolHeader="X-Forwarded-Proto"
          remoteIpHeader="X-Forwarded-For"
          internalProxies="127\.0\.0\.1" />
   ```

   This configuration enables Tomcat to correctly recognize the original HTTPS protocol used by the client, even when requests are forwarded through a proxy or load balancer.

3. Locate the `<Host>` element of your web service and add the following `RewriteValve` configuration inside it:

   ```xml
   <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.rewrite.RewriteValve" />

   <Context path="/your-webservice-path" docBase="your-webapp-name" reloadable="true">
       <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.rewrite.RewriteValve" />
   </Context>
   ```

4. Create a file named `rewrite.config` in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation.

5. Add the following configuration to `rewrite.config`:

   ```plaintext
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^your-old-hostname\.com$
   RewriteRule ^/your-webservice-path/(.*)$ https://your-new-hostname.com/your-new-webservice-path/$1 [R=301,L]
   ```

   Replace `your-old-hostname.com` with the current hostname used for the web service and `your-new-hostname.com` with the new desired hostname. Similarly, adjust `your-webservice-path` and `your-new-webservice-path` to match the paths specific to your web service.

6. Save `rewrite.config` and restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.

With this configuration, any incoming HTTPS requests to the old hostname and path will be redirected to the new HTTPS URL specified in the `rewrite.config` file.

Note: Make sure that the appropriate firewall rules and network configurations are in place to allow HTTPS traffic to reach Tomcat.

Remember to adapt the configuration based on your specific environment and requirements.

To reroute an existing HTTP web service URL to an HTTPS URL with a different domain name for each environment using Tomcat, you can use the `RewriteValve` in Tomcat along with the `rewrite.config` file. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create a `rewrite.config` file in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation.

2. Add the following configuration to `rewrite.config`:

   ```plaintext
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^old-domain\.com$
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://new-domain.com$1 [R=301,L]
   ```

   Replace `old-domain.com` with the existing HTTP domain name and `new-domain.com` with the desired HTTPS domain name. This rule will redirect all incoming requests from the old domain to the new domain using HTTPS.

3. Save `rewrite.config`.

4. In your Tomcat server configuration (`server.xml`), locate the `<Host>` element of your web service and add the following `RewriteValve` configuration inside it:

   ```xml
   <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.rewrite.RewriteValve" />
   <Context path="/your-webservice-path" docBase="your-webapp-name" reloadable="true">
       <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.rewrite.RewriteValve" />
   </Context>
   ```

   Replace `/your-webservice-path` with the path of your web service and `your-webapp-name` with the name of your web application.

5. Restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.

With this configuration, any incoming HTTP requests to the old domain will be redirected to the new HTTPS domain specified in the `rewrite.config` file.

Remember to adapt the configuration based on your specific environment and requirements, including adjusting the domain names, paths, and other relevant settings.
